## Description

💡 A highly advanced, automated technical analysis tool designed to objectively identify structural market swings and project key Fibonacci retracement and extension levels. By isolating mathematically confirmed pivot highs and lows, the algorithm eliminates the subjective bias traditionally associated with drawing retracement tools manually. The script dynamically maps out critical zones of interest—such as the widely observed Golden Pocket—while continuously evaluating the current price action against these historical vectors. Coupled with a real-time analytical dashboard, it provides traders with a comprehensive breakdown of swing volatility, level proximity, and directional bias, serving as a complete ecosystem for retracement-based methodologies.

[b]✨ Originality and Utility[/b]
The primary utility of this script lies in its capacity to transform a traditionally manual and subjective charting process into an automated, mathematically rigorous system. While standard charting platforms require users to manually select anchor points for Fibonacci tools—often leading to inconsistent application—this script programmatically identifies the most statistically relevant extremums based on user-defined lookback periods. 

Its originality is further highlighted by its multi-layered filtering architecture. Rather than treating every minor price fluctuation as a valid swing, the script incorporates an objective volatility filter utilizing either the Average True Range (ATR) or a strict percentage threshold. This ensures that only structurally significant market movements are measured, effectively filtering out stochastic market noise. Furthermore, the integration of an on-chart analytical dashboard and a dynamic level-touch highlighting system brings a level of interactive feedback rarely seen in standard visualization tools, allowing traders to instantly gauge the health and maturity of an active swing.

[b]🔬 Methodology and Concepts[/b]
[b]● Pivot Extrema Detection[/b]
The foundational logic relies on the identification of local minimums and maximums within a continuous time-series dataset. The algorithm evaluates a central candidate bar against a defined window of preceding and succeeding bars. A Pivot High is only confirmed if the candidate's high remains unbreached across the entire evaluation window, ensuring it represents a true structural peak. This mechanism inherently requires a confirmation delay to validate the peak, preventing the erratic shifting of anchors during live price formation.

[b]● Swing Filtering and Validation[/b]
Once opposing pivot points are confirmed, the script calculates the absolute price range of the resulting swing. To prevent false positives in low-volatility environments, the script applies a normalization filter. It evaluates the raw swing range against either a fractional multiplier of the current ATR or a static percentage of the asset's price. Swings failing to meet this geometric threshold are automatically discarded, preserving chart clarity.

[b]● Fibonacci Mathematics and Zonal Mapping[/b]
Upon validating a swing, the algorithm applies standard Fibonacci sequence ratios to the defined price vector. It calculates core retracements (0.236, 0.382, 0.500, 0.618, 0.786) and projects mathematical extensions (1.272, 1.618, 2.000) for target mapping. The script specifically isolates the 0.618 to 0.650 region, commonly referred to as the Golden Pocket, rendering it as a distinct filled zone to highlight its historical significance as an area of mean reversion.

[b]🎨 Visual Guide[/b]
[b]● Main Chart Elements[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Swing Line:[/b] A distinct, solid line directly connecting the anchored Pivot Low and Pivot High, visually defining the active vector being measured.
[*] [b]0.000 and 1.000 Anchors:[/b] The baseline extremums of the swing, marked by precise labels and dashed/dotted lines to indicate the absolute boundaries of the measured range.
[*] [b]Key Retracement Levels (0.382 & 0.618):[/b] Rendered with emphasized, dashed lines to denote their elevated importance in traditional retracement theory. The 0.618 level utilizes a distinct gold color to draw the user's attention.
[*] [b]Minor Retracement Levels (0.236, 0.500, 0.786):[/b] Displayed using subtle, dotted lines to provide contextual support without overwhelming the primary visual hierarchy.
[*] [b]Golden Pocket Fill:[/b] A translucent shaded region spanning the area between the 0.618 and 0.650 price coordinates, serving as a primary zone of interest for exhaustion.
[*] [b]Touch Highlights:[/b] When the current price intersects any active Fibonacci line, the line's color dynamically shifts (defaulting to white), providing immediate visual feedback of level interaction.
[*] [b]Historical Swings:[/b] If enabled, the script retains ghosted, dotted representations of previously confirmed swings, allowing users to analyze past interactions without cluttering the active setup.
[/list]

[b]● Dashboard Elements[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Direction:[/b] A color-coded textual readout confirming whether the active, validated swing is Bullish or Bearish.
[*] [b]Swing Range:[/b] A visual block-bar representation (scaling from 0 to 10) evaluating the magnitude of the current swing relative to the prevailing ATR.
[*] [b]Key Levels:[/b] Direct, high-precision price readouts for the critical 0.382 and 0.618 levels.
[*] [b]Levels Touched:[/b] A scoring metric visualizing how many individual Fibonacci levels the current price action has interacted with since the setup was confirmed.
[*] [b]0.618 Proximity:[/b] A dynamic strength bar indicating how close the current price is to the Golden Ratio, aiding in the anticipation of level tests.
[*] [b]Setup Age:[/b] A raw bar-count indicating the duration since the swing anchor was established.
[/list]

[b]📖 How to Use[/b]
[list=1]
[*] [b]Setup Identification:[/b] Apply the script to your chart and observe the automated generation of the Swing Line. The script will wait for the defined lookback period to confirm a pivot before drawing the corresponding Fibonacci grid.
[*] [b]Trend Context:[/b] Use the Dashboard to immediately confirm the direction and strength of the swing. A high Swing Range score indicates a robust structural move, lending higher confidence to the subsequent retracement levels.
[*] [b]Zone Monitoring:[/b] Focus attention on the highlighted Golden Pocket zone. As price retraces into this filled area, monitor for deceleration or reversal patterns. The built-in proximity score on the dashboard will alert you as price nears this critical threshold.
[*] [b]Interaction Feedback:[/b] Watch for the dynamic Touch Highlights. When a level changes color, it confirms that price has officially probed that mathematical coordinate.
[*] [b]Alert Automation:[/b] Instead of manually monitoring the chart, configure the script's alert parameters to notify you strictly when price touches a key level (such as the 0.382 or 0.618), streamlining your analytical workflow.
[/list]

[b]⚙️ Inputs and Settings[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Swing Settings:[/b] Controls the structural strictness of the algorithm. Adjusting the "Left Bars" alters the required validation period for a pivot, while "Extend Lines" controls the horizontal projection length of the drawn levels.
[*] [b]Swing Filter:[/b] Toggles the volatility validation on or off. Users can select between an "ATR" multiplier or a pure "Percent" requirement, establishing the minimum acceptable size for a swing to be plotted.
[*] [b]Direction Filter:[/b] Allows the user to isolate the script's output to strictly Long setups, strictly Short setups, or Both simultaneously.
[*] [b]Fib Extensions & Golden Pocket:[/b] Provides granular control over the visibility and aesthetic rendering of the >1.000 extension levels and the specialized 0.618-0.650 fill zone.
[*] [b]Level Touch Alerts:[/b] Configuration options for automating notifications. Users can toggle alerts for specific key levels, all levels collectively, and customize the visual highlight color triggered by these interactions.
[*] [b]Historical Swings:[/b] Defines the quantity of past setups to retain on the chart for retrospective analysis.
[*] [b]Dashboard Settings:[/b] Customization parameters for the analytical table's background and text colors to ensure readability across different chart themes.
[/list]

[b]🔍 Deconstruction of the Underlying Scientific and Academic Framework[/b]
The theoretical foundation of this script intersects two distinct disciplines of market analysis: algorithmic extremum detection and geometric proportion analysis. 

The extremum detection relies on a localized peak-trough evaluation algorithm. By isolating a data point and verifying that its scalar value is strictly greater than (or less than) all corresponding values within a symmetric `n`-period domain, the script establishes a mathematically unassailable structural node. This method effectively filters out continuous monotonic sequences and isolates true inflection points in the time-series data. 

To prevent the algorithm from validating micro-fluctuations inherent in random walk market environments, it employs a normalization technique using Average True Range (ATR). ATR provides a dynamic measure of standard deviation over time. By forcing the absolute scalar difference between two validated extremums to exceed a fractional coefficient of the ATR, the script ensures that the analyzed vector falls outside the bounds of standard market noise, thereby validating its statistical significance.

Once the vector is established, the script applies the principles of the Fibonacci sequence—a recursive mathematical progression where the ratio of successive terms converges on Phi (approximately 1.618). In the context of market dynamics, these ratios (particularly their inverses and square roots, such as 0.618 and 0.382) have been empirically observed to act as psychological focal points for mass market behavior. The script translates these geometric proportions into static coordinate thresholds, creating a structured, grid-based framework for evaluating the amplitude and potential exhaustion points of counter-trend market phases.

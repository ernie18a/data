No catch. No trial period. Ours to you, forever.

💡A comprehensive trend-following and market-state detection framework . It operates by generating a dynamic, volatility-adjusted trailing band that reacts not just to price movements, but to the shifting structural regimes of the asset. By analyzing True Range, historical price percentiles, and momentum simultaneously, this indicator filters out market noise and isolates high-probability directional shifts. It inherently guards against false signals during flat or consolidating markets through a multi-layered filtering matrix, ensuring that traders are presented with actionable data only when strict momentum and structural conditions are met.

[b]● ✨ Originality and Utility[/b]

Most trend-following systems rely on static multipliers or fixed lookback periods, rendering them susceptible to sudden market regime changes. The primary utility of this engine lies in its adaptive nature. It introduces a Volatility Fingerprint module that constantly scans the environment, classifying the market into distinct regimes: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. Based on this continuous assessment, the indicator autonomously scales its sensitivity, smoothing depth, and filter thresholds. This means the engine tightens its criteria during erratic, low-liquidity chop and expands its bands during high-volatility expansions, providing an organic, self-adjusting framework that eliminates the need for constant manual parameter tuning. 

[b]● 🔬 Methodology and Concepts[/b]
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/QvcozFT2/[/image]
[b]• Dynamic Trailing Core[/b]
At the heart of the engine is a composite distance formula that calculates a dynamic half-band. Instead of relying solely on a basic Average True Range (ATR) multiplier, it combines three elements: an absolute band multiplier, an ATR weight normalized against the closing price, and a raw price move weight. This composite value is then smoothed using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) alpha factor. The resulting smoothed band is applied to the median price to establish upper and lower boundaries, forming the basis of the trendline.

[b]• Volatility Fingerprinting[/b]
The script normalizes the ATR as a percentage of the closing price and ranks it against a historical lookback window using non-parametric percentile thresholds. By splitting the historical distribution into quartiles (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles), the asset's current volatility is placed into a specific bucket. The core mathematical weights and matrix thresholds are then dynamically multiplied by regime-specific scalars.

[b]• Alpha Filtering Matrix[/b]
To prevent whipsaws, the script employs a five-layer matrix that acts as a logical gatekeeper before any signal is validated:
- Trendline Stall: Measures the absolute change in the trendline against a fraction of the ATR.
- Slope Regression: Computes the linear regression slope of the trendline over a rolling window and normalizes it.
- Volume Gate: Compares current volume to a dynamic simple moving average of volume.
- Range Gate: Checks if the current bar's High-Low range exceeds a specific historical percentile.
- Basis Point (BPS) Delta: Ensures the trendline shift meets a minimum percentage threshold.

[b]• Breakout Override[/b]
If the market suddenly explodes with extreme momentum, a Breakout Override function bypasses the filtering matrix. If the absolute change in price heavily exceeds a set multiple of the ATR, the system immediately forces engagement to capture the breakout.

[b]● 🎨 Visual Guide[/b]
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/d6yq49hf/[/image]
[b]• Dynamic Trendline[/b]
A solid line plots the active trailing stop and trend direction. By default, it is colored Cyan for a Bullish trend and Magenta for a Bearish trend. This line steps up or down along with price action, providing a clear visual anchor for the current structural bias.

[b]• Dynamic Bar Coloring[/b]
The chart's candlesticks are dynamically colored using a visual gradient. The script measures the normalized distance of the closing price from the trendline. When price is near the trendline, candles assume a neutral slate-blue tone. As momentum carries price further away, the color interpolates into bright Cyan (Bullish) or Magenta (Bearish), immediately illustrating trend strength.

[b]• Cloud Fill[/b]
A semi-transparent cloud is drawn between the primary trendline and a smoothed moving average of the typical price. This creates a visual "value zone" on the chart, helping users quickly identify the spatial relationship between the current trend anchor and the smoothed price core.

[b]• HUD Dashboard[/b]
A comprehensive heads-up display is positioned in the top-right corner of the chart. It outputs real-time diagnostic data:
- Direction: Displays the current structural bias (Bullish/Bearish).
- Signal: Indicates if an actionable Buy or Sell signal is present.
- Override: Shows the status of the Breakout Override (Off, Nominal, or Engaged in Orange).
- Matrix Pillars: Five rows display the status of the Stall, Slope, Volume, Range, and BPS Delta filters. A Red "Flat" tag indicates the filter is blocking signals, while a Green "Active" tag indicates the path is clear.
- VF Regime: The bottom row explicitly states the current volatility state (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, or Delta) with corresponding color codes.

[b]• Signal Labels[/b]
When a directional flip occurs and the matrix conditions are met, explicit "BUY" (Upward pointing, subtle green) or "SELL" (Downward pointing, subtle red) labels are plotted precisely at the trendline level.

[b]• Non-Standard Chart Warning[/b]
If the user applies the script to Heikin Ashi, Renko, Line Break, Kagi, or Point & Figure charts, a bold Red warning table will appear in the top-left corner. This warns the user that standard signals may repaint due to the synthetic price data of non-standard charts.

📌 Note : the best way to resolve visual overlap is to navigate to the Object Tree and drag the indicator above the main chart layer, or simply hide the native candles in your chart settings. 
 
[b]● 📖 How to Use[/b]
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/izXbes4d/[/image]
[b]• Identifying Entries[/b]
Wait for a clear crossover of the closing price over the dynamic trendline. For a valid entry, ensure the HUD Dashboard confirms the matrix conditions are "Active" and not "Flat." The emergence of a defined BUY or SELL label serves as the primary action trigger.

[b]• Managing the Trade[/b]
Once in a position, the dynamic trendline serves as a logical trailing stop-loss level. As the trendline steps in the direction of the trade, users can manually trail their risk. The color gradient on the bars provides a secondary gauge; fading colors suggest weakening momentum and a potential reversion to the mean.

[b]• Regime Awareness[/b]
Monitor the VF Regime status on the dashboard. In "Alpha" or "Beta" (lower volatility), expect tighter bands and slower movements. In "Gamma" or "Delta" (extreme volatility), be prepared for wider stops and aggressive price action. The indicator will automatically handle the mathematical adjustments, but position sizing should reflect the increased environmental risk.

[b]• Repaint Warning Note[/b]
Always utilize this indicator on standard candlestick or bar charts. The underlying calculations depend on absolute close, high, and low values. Applying this to Heikin Ashi will cause lookahead bias and repainting signals.

🏆 Golden Rule — Before You Trade This Indicator:

Never rely on the default settings, every asset behaves differently. Every timeframe has its own rhythm. Default settings are a starting point — not a strategy.

The best configuration is the one you build yourself, through deliberate testing:
[list=1]
[*]Adjust the settings methodically until false signals are minimized and entry/exit accuracy is maximized.
[*]Test on your specific asset. Test on your specific timeframe. Then lock in what works.
[/list]
The trader who takes time to configure is the trader who profits consistently.


[b]● ⚙️ Inputs and Settings[/b]

[b]• Volatility Fingerprint Group[/b]
Allows users to toggle the adaptive engine on or off, and set the lookback length used to determine the historical percentiles for regime classification.

[b]• Core Engine Parameters[/b]
Controls the baseline foundation. Adjust the ATR period, the absolute Band Multiplier, the relative ATR Weight, the Price Move Weight, and the EMA Smoothing Length. When VF is enabled, these act as the baseline from which multipliers scale.

[b]• Alpha Filtering Matrix[/b]
Provides granular control over the five anti-chop filters. Users can toggle each filter independently and adjust their strictness, such as the Flatness Threshold, Regression Length, Slope Threshold, Volume MA Length, and Range Percentile.

[b]• Display & Cloud Configuration[/b]
Permits full aesthetic customization of the Bull/Bear colors, neutral gradient tones, visibility of the dashboard, signal labels, and the transparency parameters of the cloud fill.

[b]• Alert Actions[/b]
Customizable string inputs that feed directly into the JSON webhook alert system, allowing automated traders to define syntax for Long, Short, Close Long, and Close Short actions.

[b]● 🔍 Deconstruction of the Underlying Scientific and Academic Framework[/b]

[b]• Autoregressive Smoothing and Moving Averages[/b]
The system employs an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to smooth its dynamic raw band. The mathematical alpha factor is defined as 2 / (N + 1), where N is the user-defined smoothing length. This recursive formula assigns geometrically decreasing weights to older observations, ensuring the trendline remains highly responsive to recent price vectors while mathematically filtering high-frequency noise.

[b]• Non-Parametric Rank Statistics[/b]
To evaluate the volatility state, the script calculates the nearest-rank percentile of the normalized ATR over a rolling window. Unlike standard standard-deviation bands (such as Bollinger Bands) that assume a normal Gaussian distribution of returns, this non-parametric percentile approach does not assume normality. This is statistically robust for financial time series, which exhibit leptokurtic (fat-tailed) distributions, ensuring accurate classification even during severe market outliers.

[b]• Linear Regression and Slope Normalization[/b]
The Slope Filter relies on the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression of the trendline. By calculating the change between the current linear regression value and the previous bar's value, it extracts a pure mathematical slope. To make this slope asset-agnostic, it is normalized by dividing the raw slope by the ATR, yielding a dimensionless ratio that accurately represents directional velocity regardless of the instrument's absolute price.

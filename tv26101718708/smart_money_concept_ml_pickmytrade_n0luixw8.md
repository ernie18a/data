## Description

Price breaks a swing level. Do you take the break, or wait for a retest?
Smart Money Concept ML brings that question onto the chart: structure and liquidity mapped together, a retest estimate recorded at each swing break, and a running check of how those estimates compare with what actually happened.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/NfVO6dVH/
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

🔷 WHAT IT MEASURES

🔸 Break of Structure (BOS) in the established direction and Change of Character (CHoCH) against it, using confirmed swing points
🔸 Order blocks, optional fair value gaps, equal highs and lows, and the protected and opposing extremes of the current range
🔸 Order blocks, optional fair value gaps, equal highs and lows, and the protected and opposing extremes of the current range. Optional internal structure shows shorter swings; premium/discount shading shows the two halves of the dealing range
🔸 Retest odds — the estimated chance of price touching the broken swing level within the selected number of bars. A touch counts as a retest; it does not require a bounce or a successful trade
🔸 Liquidity odds — the estimated chance of the nearest untaken pool above price being traded through before the nearest pool below, and vice versa
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

🔷 THE LEARNING ENGINE

🔸 Retest estimates begin with a random-walk calculation using distance from the broken level, recent price-change volatility, and the retest window. The mathematical basis is the reflection principle
🔸 Liquidity estimates begin with the standard gambler’s-ruin first-touch calculation: where price sits between two boundaries
🔸 Bayesian logistic calibration adjusts these starting estimates as outcomes resolve on the chart. Retest calibration learns an intercept and slope; liquidity calibration learns a slope while preserving complementary upper and lower odds
🔸 This calibration is the learned component behind “ML.” Structure detection, zones, and signal rules are explicitly defined in the code
🔸 Each calibration fit uses its latest 500 resolved observations at most, with a prior that pulls it toward the starting formula when evidence is limited. The table reads LEARNING until 30 break observations have been scored as retested or not retested; fitting already takes place during that period. Displayed scoring totals can exceed 500
🔸 Each recorded estimate is scored before its own outcome is used to update the model
🔸 A retest observation resolves on its first later touch or when its window expires. Liquidity calibration samples qualifying setups at swing breaks; setups that cross both pools on one bar or remain unresolved after 1,000 bars are excluded
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

🔷 CHECKING THE EVIDENCE

🔸 Calibration compares the average recorded estimate with the observed event rate and shows the sample count. Tooltips add probability-error comparisons against the unadjusted formula and the chart’s running base rate
🔸 The Edge Test compares three groups: BOS versus CHoCH, breaks with versus without a fair value gap in the leg, and breaks preceded versus not preceded by a liquidity sweep
🔸 Follow-through means a close one risk unit beyond the break close before a close through the protected swing. Unresolved observations expire after 150 bars and are excluded
🔸 A two-proportion test, adjusted for the three comparisons, checks whether an observed difference exceeds its statistical threshold. This describes the loaded sample; it does not establish a lasting trading advantage
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

🔷 SIGNALS AND DISPLAY

🔸 Break Close records a hypothetical entry on a qualifying confirmed swing break. Level Retest waits within the selected window for a later bar to touch the level and close back beyond it in the break direction; a close through the protected swing cancels the setup. Adaptive waits only when the retest estimate meets its threshold
🔸 Stops sit beyond the protected swing, with an ATR buffer. Two targets are expressed as multiples of initial risk, with an optional move of the stop to entry after TP1
🔸 One signal is tracked at a time. Same-direction signals are skipped; an opposing signal closes the existing position at the bar’s close
🔸 The hypothetical Record scores half the position at TP1 and the remainder at TP2 or another exit. If TP1 is never reached, the full position is scored at the exit. It reports average R, adds an approximate 95% interval from 10 closed signals, and labels fewer than 30 as too few to judge
🔸 Blue marks bullish structure and orange marks bearish structure. Display toggles control the zones and labels; Zen Mode hides labels and the table
🔸 Alerts cover structure breaks, liquidity sweeps, and signal events. Select “Any alert() function call” for the combined entry and exit stream, available as Text or JSON
🔸 Eight separate alert conditions cover BUY, SELL, signal closure, bullish and bearish CHoCH, bullish and bearish BOS, and liquidity sweeps. The combined Text/JSON signal stream is described below
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

🔷 ALERTS AND AUTOMATION

🔸 Supports webhook-based automation through TradingView alerts and an external receiver configured for this script’s message format. The indicator generates signals; the receiving service handles order execution
🔸 Choose Text for readable notifications or JSON for structured integration. JSON includes source, event, action, position, side, symbol, timeframe, price, entry, sl, tp1, and tp2
🔸 Signal events include entry, TP1, TP2, stop loss, stop at entry, timeout, and reversal. The action field identifies buy, sell, partial_close, or close. The side field describes the original position direction, including on exits; receivers should use action and position to interpret an exit
🔸 After selecting the symbol, timeframe, and script inputs, set Alert Message Format to JSON and create an alert using “Any alert() function call.” Add your receiver’s webhook URL in the alert settings. TradingView requires two-factor authentication for webhooks
🔸 Messages are emitted on confirmed bar closes. A reported stop or target price is the script’s reference price for the event, not confirmation of an external fill. On a reversal, the close message is sent before the new entry message
🔸 The payload does not include order quantity, account credentials, or a unique event ID. Position sizing, symbol mapping, duplicate handling, and execution rules must be configured in the receiver. Compatibility with a particular execution platform depends on its required payload
🔸 A TP2 event can occur without a separate TP1 message. If multiple exit events occur on one bar, only the final assigned exit message is sent. The receiver must account for this when managing partial exits; the chart’s hypothetical 50% allocation is not an order-size instruction in the payload
🔸 Recreate the alert after changing script code, inputs, symbol, or timeframe: an existing TradingView alert runs its saved configuration. Hiding Buy/Sell signals changes their display; it does not disable the underlying alert logic
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

🔷 INPUTS

Swing Length / Internal Length — bars on each side needed to confirm a pivot. Defaults 10 / 3.
Order Blocks — number retained per side. Default 2.
Fair Value Gap Minimum / Equal-Level Tolerance — defaults 0.30 / 0.15 ATR.
Retest Window — time allowed for a return to the broken level. Default 20 bars.
Entry — Break Close, Level Retest, or Adaptive. Default Break Close.
Adaptive Threshold — estimate required to wait for a retest in Adaptive mode. Default 80%.
Breaks That Signal — CHoCH, BOS, or both. Default both.
Stop Buffer / Maximum Risk — defaults 0.20 / 6.0 ATR; wider setups are skipped.
TP1 / TP2 — defaults 1R / 2R. Stop to entry after TP1 is enabled by default.
Trade Timeout — default 150 bars.
Alert Message Format — Text or JSON. Default Text.
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

🔷 REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS

🔸 Use standard price bars. Synthetic chart prices can distort the measurements and hypothetical fills
🔸 Pivots become available only after their right-side confirmation bars close. A swing marker identifies an earlier bar; it was not available on that bar
🔸 Breaks, signals, and recorded estimates are committed at bar close. Live liquidity odds and the premium/discount reading can change during the current bar
🔸 Learning starts from the loaded history. Loading a different stretch of data can change calibration, historical estimates, diagnostics, and Adaptive signals
🔸 Random-walk assumptions simplify market behavior. Overlapping observations can also make statistical intervals appear more precise than the evidence warrants
🔸 Retest and liquidity percentages describe specific touch events, not win rates. The signal record is hypothetical, excludes commission and slippage, and is not a Strategy Tester backtest
🔸 When a later bar touches both a stop and a target, the record gives the stop priority. Chart bars cannot reveal every intrabar price sequence

// This Pine Script® code is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0
// at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/
//
// Smart Money Concept ML
//
// WHAT IT DOES
// Draws the Smart Money Concepts map (swing and internal breaks of structure
// and changes of character, order blocks, fair value gaps, equal highs and
// lows, strong and weak highs and lows, premium and discount) and attaches to
// it only numbers that are scored against what actually happened on the same
// chart. Where a number has nothing behind it, the script says so.
//
// ABOUT THE NAME
// "ML" here is one learned component: a two-parameter Bayesian logistic
// regression, a supervised model that refits the retest and liquidity odds to
// this chart's own resolved outcomes each time one resolves. There is no
// neural network, no pattern matching, and nothing in the script forecasts
// direction. Structure, zones and signals are fixed rules. Until 30 breaks
// have resolved the table reads LEARNING and the odds stay at the random-walk
// formula. Richer learned models (nearest-neighbour votes, multi-feature
// regressions, a learned time-of-day volatility profile) were tested during
// development and did not beat that formula out of sample, so they are not
// used.
//
// RETEST ODDS
// After every swing break: the chance that price trades back to the broken
// level within the Retest Window. The estimate starts from the probability
// that a random walk with this chart's current bar-to-bar volatility touches a
// level that far away in that many bars (the reflection principle). A
// Bayesian logistic calibration, whose prior is centred on that formula, then
// adjusts it with the breaks already resolved on this chart. With little
// history the formula is used as it is; the adjustment grows only as far as
// the chart's own outcomes support it.
//
// LIQUIDITY ODDS
// For the nearest untaken pool above price (equal highs or a swing high) and
// the nearest below: the chance that each is traded through before the other.
// It starts from the first-touch probability of a random walk between the two
// pools (the distance to the far pool over the distance between them) and is
// calibrated the same way on this chart's resolved setups.
//
// CALIBRATION
// Every retest figure is recorded when its break prints and scored when its
// window closes. The liquidity figure on the chart follows the live price and
// is not itself recorded: its calibration uses the same calculation taken at
// each swing break with a pool on each side, scored when exactly one pool is
// traded through (both on one bar is left out, and only setups a random walk
// resolves inside the window are taken). The Calibration row compares the
// average recorded odds with how often the event happened, with the count.
// The tooltip adds the Brier skill against the chart's plain base rate and
// against the uncalibrated formula.
//
// EDGE TEST
// Smart Money Concepts implies that some breaks follow through more often than
// others. The script checks this on the chart instead of assuming it. Each
// swing break is followed until it closes one risk unit beyond its break close
// (the distance back to its protected swing) or closes back through the
// protected swing; both finish lines are closes, so a random walk scores 50%
// whatever the size of the leg. A break that does neither within 150 bars is
// left out. Three splits are tested: BOS against CHoCH, legs that left
// a fair value gap against legs that did not, and legs that swept liquidity
// first against legs that did not. A two-proportion z-test with a Bonferroni
// correction for the three splits (|z| of 2.39 or more) decides whether a
// split differs by more than chance. When it does not, the row also estimates
// how many breaks of each kind would be needed to detect the observed gap.
//
// SIGNALS
// BUY comes only from bullish swing structure and SELL only from bearish. The
// entry is the close of the break bar (Break Close) or the close of the first
// bar that trades back to the broken level and closes beyond it again within
// the Retest Window (Level Retest). Adaptive waits for the retest only when
// the retest odds are at or above its threshold. One signal is open at a
// time: a new signal in the same direction is skipped and an opposite one
// closes the open signal at that bar's close. The stop sits beyond the
// protected swing and both targets are multiples of that risk; a bar that
// opens beyond the stop or a target is filled at its open. The Record row
// scores half the position at TP1 and the rest at TP2, the stop, or the close
// of the bar where the signal timed out or was reversed, and shows the average
// R with a 95% interval. All outcomes are hypothetical, with no commission or
// slippage, and depend on the amount of history loaded. One alert() call
// carries every entry and exit with its prices, as text or JSON.
//
// NON-REPAINTING
// Every break, signal, outcome and recorded odds figure is fixed when its bar
// closes. Swing points print Swing Length bars after the bar they mark and
// never move afterwards. No request.security() call is made and no future
// data is used. Two figures follow the live price on the last bar and are not
// recorded: the liquidity odds (labels and row) and the premium / discount
// percentage in the Bias row. The calibration, the record and the edge test
// start from the first loaded bar, so they can differ after a reload that
// loads a different stretch of history. Drawings are rebuilt from the recorded
// history on the last bar only.
//
// ATTRIBUTION
// Break of structure, change of character, order block, fair value gap, equal
// highs and lows, premium and discount and liquidity are public Smart Money
// Concepts terms, implemented independently here; no code from any other
// Smart Money Concepts script is used. The reflection principle, the
// gambler's-ruin first-touch probability, logistic calibration and the
// two-proportion z-test are standard mathematics. The alert layer follows
// this author's own earlier scripts.
//
// Recommended alert setting: "Once Per Bar Close".

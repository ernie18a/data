## Description

▪️Strong Fibo Clusters maps the one thing a level trader actually wants to see — the prices where last week's entire swing structure agrees a reaction should happen — and grades each one before price arrives. A single Fibonacci retracement drawn off a single swing is a guess; it depends entirely on which two points you picked. This indicator removes the pick. It takes every meaningful swing high and low from the prior period, runs all of them through your full retracement set, and overlays the results. 

▪️Where many independent swing pairs land their fibs on the same price, that agreement is confluence — and confluence is where price turns. A lone, unconfirmed fib prints nothing. A price that several swing pairs all point to prints a graded, teal-shaded cluster zone with its whole read-out inside the box. Then last week's high and low are carried forward as live liquidity lines and watched for the tell: a sweep beyond the level that fails and reclaims.

▪️Most Fibonacci and support/resistance tools draw one level off one swing you hand-pick and leave you to guess which matters. This one derives every swing pair automatically from a full anchor period, stacks all their retracements, only draws a zone where several agree, ranks it by how many agree, and refuses to call the turn until a failed break at the prior extreme proves the trapped side is being taken.

🎯 The Confluence Engine — the core. Every zone is born from the prior period's swing pivots, but a single pivot pair is not a level. At each period close the engine pairs every qualifying swing high with every qualifying swing low, projects your enabled retracements (0.236 → 1.000) from each pair, and clusters the results: levels landing within your ATR tolerance of one another collapse into a single zone whose strength is the number of independent swing pairs that agree on it. Two pairs in agreement is a MEDIUM zone; four to five, STRONG; six or more, ELITE. Only clusters that clear your Min Cluster Strength survive, they are ranked strongest-first, and a minimum-separation filter stops the map crowding. Isolated one-off fibs are filtered out. Only genuine agreement becomes a zone.

🧭 Weekly Anchoring — where the levels come from. The map is rebuilt on last week's data, not the whole chart. Choose the anchor — weekly by default, or bi-weekly / monthly — and every new period the engine reads the swings from the period(s) just completed, computes fresh clusters, and projects them across the new period. Each week's map then freezes in place when the next begins, so you keep a running history of prior maps (the last N periods, your choice) instead of one shifting overlay. This week's zones are literally built from last week's structure.

📐 Retracements, Golden Pocket & Extensions — the full range, not just the middle. Every cluster is a retracement confluence, but the prior range itself is drawn too. The Golden Pocket (0.5–0.618 of last period's range) is shaded as the premium reversal band, a dotted Equilibrium marks the 50% mid, and measured Fibonacci extensions project beyond the range — 1.13 and 1.27 above the high, −0.13 and −0.27 below the low — as continuation targets for when price accepts through instead of turning. Retracements tell you where it might reverse; extensions tell you where it is headed if it doesn't.

⚡ Sweep · Acceptance · Failed Break — the weekly lifecycle. The prior period's high and low are the week's most important liquidity — where the obvious stops sit. They are carried forward as live lines and graded through four states. INTACT until touched. A wick beyond the level that closes back inside is a SWEEP — a liquidity grab. A close decisively beyond is ACCEPTANCE — the level gave way. And an acceptance that then closes back inside is a FAILED BREAK — the highest-odds reversal tell on the chart, the trapped breakout getting flushed. Each state recolors the line and drops a marker so the flip is impossible to miss.

🧲 Virgin Magnets — the unfinished business. A cluster or a prior extreme that its own period never traded into is left unfilled, and unfinished business pulls price. Instead of deleting these when the period rolls, the engine promotes any untouched level to a persistent virgin magnet: a projecting dotted line that keeps pointing right until price finally tags it, then it is marked done. Virgin levels are where price is most likely to be dragged back.

🏷️ In-Zone Labels — the read, inside the box. Every cluster carries its full read-out on the zone itself: its rank among the week's clusters, its tier (ELITE / STRONG / MEDIUM), its strength — the exact number of swing pairs in agreement — and its anchor price. The prior high and low read PREV WEEK HIGH / LOW and update with their live state (SWEPT / ACCEPTED / FAILED BREAK). One glance tells you what each level is, how much agreement built it, and where it stands right now.

📏 Period Separators & normalised zones — a bounded, consistent map. A vertical divider marks the first bar of every anchor period, so each week / bi-week / month is visually bounded. Every zone is normalised to one clean ATR-based thickness centred on its level — so the map reads consistently instead of a mess of fat and thin boxes — and all drawings extend to the live bar and project forward a configurable distance.

🧼 Clean-Chart Discipline — zones and nothing else. No moving-average spaghetti, no oscillator sub-pane, no dashboard, no stat table. Just graded confluence zones, the golden pocket, equilibrium and extension lines, the two weekly liquidity levels and their labels. Keep-last-N-periods, overlap separation and magnet caps keep only what matters on screen; everything else lives in the alerts.

🎨 Fully Themed & Configurable. The palette ships teal for the confluence tiers (Elite / Strong / Medium, darkening with strength) and magenta for the extensions, with neutral gray for the golden pocket, equilibrium and magnets — all fully editable, with adjustable transparency, borders and label size. Tune the whole engine: anchor period and source-swings lookback, swing length and count, which retracements fire, cluster tolerance and minimum pair range, min strength, max clusters and separation, zone thickness, golden-pocket fibs, extension toggles, sweep and acceptance thresholds, magnet count and style, and how many periods stay drawn.

🔒 Honest, Synthetic Core. This is a structural confluence-mapping tool, not a backtested edge and not a promise that price will react at any level. It infers levels from prior-period price alone — no real order flow, no positioning feed — so it runs on any market. Strength is exactly what it says: the count of independent swing pairs whose fibs agree, nothing hidden or curve-fit. Pivots confirm a few bars after the swing (that is how pivots work), so a cluster is computed at the period boundary from confirmed swings and then fixed — it does not repaint afterward — but a sweep or reclaim on the live bar can still change until the bar closes. Run it on a timeframe below your anchor (e.g. 1H–4H under a weekly anchor); it will warn you if the chart timeframe is too high for clusters to resolve.

🔔 Native Alerts. Cluster / zone touched fires as price reaches a confluence zone; Sweep above / below prior high / low and Acceptance above / below track the weekly liquidity lifecycle; Failed break above / below fires the reversal tell — the flushed breakout; and Virgin magnet tagged fires when price finally reaches an untouched level. Set it once and let the chart stay silent until price is at a level that matters.

🎯 Why this is different. One fib off one swing is only as good as the two points you picked, and a single support line is static and un-graded. Strong Fibo Clusters removes the pick entirely — it pairs the whole prior period, stacks every retracement, and only marks the prices where independent swings agree, ranked by how many. Then it refuses to call the turn until a failed break at the week's liquidity proves the trapped side is being taken — on any symbol, at any timeframe.

🚀 Apply to Gold (XAUUSD), Silver, Forex, Crypto, Indices and Futures on any intra-period timeframe. Because clusters are volatility-normalised and anchored to whole periods, the read travels across symbols and timeframes without re-tuning.

💡 Cleanest setup: raise Min Cluster Strength so only heavily-agreed zones print; keep the full retracement set on so more pairs can converge; widen separation and cap the periods drawn for a de-cluttered map; keep virgin magnets on so unfinished levels keep pulling price; and drop to an intra-period timeframe so the prior period holds enough swings to cluster.

🎯 How To Trade It — Two Approaches

Everything hinges on one read: where does last week's structure agree, and has price arrived tired or flushed the level yet?

🧱 1) Fade the confluence — the reaction at agreement

Use on the first tap of a dense, high-strength cluster while price arrives extended.

▪️Read the grade — an ELITE / STRONG cluster (many swing pairs agreeing), and especially one sitting inside the Golden Pocket, is a wall worth leaning on; a MEDIUM or lone level is not.
Trigger: fade the first touch back toward the mean, ideally when price arrives over-extended into the zone.

▪️Target: the 50% Equilibrium, the opposite side of the range, or the next cluster.
Stop: beyond the far edge of the zone.
Invalidation: acceptance through it. Once price closes decisively beyond the cluster it is a break, not a bounce — stand aside, or turn and ride the extension target.

⚡ 2) Trade the weekly flip — the confirmed reversal or continuation

Use the prior-week high and low as the decision line.

▪️Wait for the tell — a sweep of the prior high that fails and reclaims (FAILED BREAK) is a short-side flush; a sweep of the prior low that fails and reclaims is a long-side flush. That failed break at the week's liquidity is the highest-odds reversal on the chart.

▪️Or trade acceptance — a decisive close beyond the level (ACCEPTANCE, not a reclaim) says the trapped side is taken; trade continuation toward the 1.13 / 1.27 (or −0.13 / −0.27) extension target.

▪️Trigger: enter on the confirming close — the reclaim for the reversal, the acceptance for the continuation.

▪️Target: the mean / opposite cluster for the reversal; the extension target for the continuation.
Stop: beyond the sweep extreme for the reversal; back inside the level for the continuation.

🧲 Bias overlay — a virgin magnet (an untouched prior high, low or cluster) is unfinished business. Expect price to be drawn toward it and treat it as a natural target for either approach.

✋ Stand down — the map says wait

MEDIUM or lone clusters are minor agreement, not walls — nothing to lean on.
A prior level that has been swept but has not reclaimed is still in play — wait for the close.
No cluster near price, or price mid-range between zones — wait for contact with a ranked zone and let the alert bring you in.
Chart timeframe at or above the anchor — drop lower so clusters can form.

Rule of thumb: 🧱 Dense ELITE cluster (bonus: Golden Pocket) + tired arrival on first touch → fade toward Equilibrium until acceptance proves otherwise. ⚡ Prior-week level swept and reclaimed → trade the flush back to the mean. 🎯 Prior level accepted through → ride it to the extension target. ❄️ Weak or lone clusters, or no level near price → stand down until the structure lines up.

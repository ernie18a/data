# EvoD Trader Range

Source: https://www.tradingview.com/script/0U67bc6C-EvoD-Trader-Range/

## Description

**EvoD Trader Range — Market-Open Range Backtester with 12-Signal Exit Simulation**

A range/opening-range-breakout backtesting and alerting tool for futures, stocks, and forex, anchored to your choice of New York, London, or Tokyo market opens — or the CME's daily maintenance reopen for futures-specific setups.

**What it does**

- Builds a price range around a configurable window (Initial Balance, Opening Range, EvoD ORB, or CME-anchored shapes), then tracks 12 independent signal types off that range: breakouts (BOL/BOS), failed-auction reversals (FAL/FAS), mid-range crosses (MIDL/MIDS), and six wick-rejection patterns at the range high, low, and midpoint (WHL/WHS/WLL/WLS/WML/WMS).
- Only one trade is ever considered "live" at a time across all 12 signals — whichever fires first takes the slot until it stops out or reaches its final target.
- Every signal shares one stop model: the tighter of an ATR-based stop off the entry candle's body (or the wick bar's extreme, for the six wick signals) versus a cap of 25% of the day's range height — so risk never exceeds a fixed fraction of the range regardless of how wide ATR gets.
- Targets sit at 50%/100%/200% of the day's range height from entry, with three configurable exit styles: scale out across all three legs (moving to breakeven after the first), or take the full position at a single target.
- A consolidated performance table reports trade count, win rate, target-touch rates, expectancy (points and $), profit factor, drawdown, and a per-weekday win/loss breakdown for every enabled signal plus a combined total — with a CSV export to Pine Logs for further analysis.

**How to use it**

Add it to a 5-minute chart, pick a Range Shape and Market from the Preset group (or Custom for manual session times), enable the signals you want to track, and set a Start/End Date to backtest a specific window.

---

**Backtesting limitations — read before trusting the numbers**

This is a visual/statistical simulation built from confirmed-bar price data, not TradingView's Strategy Tester, and not a substitute for a real broker fill model:

- **No slippage, commissions, or execution latency are modeled.** Entries are simulated at the signal bar's close; stops and targets are simulated as filled instantly at the exact level, the moment intrabar price touches it. In a live account, fast or thin markets can fill you meaningfully worse than these levels — especially on gap-through-stop scenarios, which this script does not distinguish from a clean stop fill.
- **Targets register on intrabar high/low touch, not on a confirmed close.** A wick that barely tags a target counts the same as a strong close through it.
- **Same-bar stop/target conflicts resolve conservatively as a stop-out**, which may understate results relative to what a live fill would actually do (or overstate them, if your real fills would have favored the target).
- **Only one trade is tracked at a time, script-wide.** If you'd realistically take multiple signals simultaneously with separate capital, this backtest understates your actual trade frequency and doesn't reflect the correlation risk of holding several correlated positions at once.
- **Results depend entirely on the chart's loaded history and your Start/End Date settings.** A narrow window, a single instrument, or a period with unusually favorable/unfavorable conditions for a given signal is not a reliable estimate of forward performance.
- **The Range Quality Filter, holiday exclusions, and session/timezone logic all shape which days even get counted** — changing any of them changes the sample, not just the results on a fixed sample.
- Past performance shown by this or any backtest, simulated or real, does not guarantee future results. This script is for research and education, not financial advice — always forward-test on a demo/sim account before risking real capital.

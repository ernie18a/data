## Description

🔷 WHAT IS ST-EP06 — ISOTROPIC TREND LINES?

ST-EP06 is a multi-scale structural trend channel indicator built on a σ-normalized coordinate system. It is designed to solve one of the oldest unaddressed problems in technical analysis: 

trend angles that cannot be compared across instruments, timeframes, or volatility regimes.

A trend line drawn on a chart appears to carry a measurable angle — yet that angle is an artifact of the display window, not a property of the market. Resize the chart horizontally and the slope flattens; compress it and the slope steepens. A given price movement on Gold daily and Bitcoin 1-hour may produce visually identical slopes on screen while reflecting entirely different structural conditions. This happens because traditional charts use a coordinate space where the vertical axis (price) and the horizontal axis (time) share no fixed dimensional relationship.

The consequence is not merely cosmetic. A trader cannot meaningfully compare the steepness of a trend on one instrument with another — or even across timeframes on the same instrument — because the weight of "one unit of price per bar" varies with the instrument's current volatility.

As the author of this indicator, I sought a coordinate system where trend angles would be an intrinsic structural property of the market, independent of charting software or display settings. The goal: a space where a 30° uptrend on EUR/USD weekly carries the same structural meaning as a 30° uptrend on NASDAQ 5-minute — indicating that each market is moving at the same rate relative to its own realized volatility.

The solution draws on the principle of dimensional analysis, well established in physics and engineering. Just as the Reynolds number normalizes fluid flow to make behavior comparable across different pipe sizes and fluid viscosities, this indicator normalizes price movement by realized volatility, producing a dimensionless space we call the Isotropic Coordinate System (ICS).

In ICS, price is expressed in natural logarithmic form and scaled by a volatility estimate (σ) derived from the Yang-Zhang (2000) method — a drift-invariant estimator that incorporates Open, High, Low, and Close data. The resulting vertical axis is dimensionless: one unit equals one standard deviation of recent realized price behavior. When trend angles are measured in this space, 45° indicates approximately one σ of movement per bar — whether the chart shows a penny stock, a major currency pair, or a commodity index.

Traditional chart coordinates assign no fixed relationship between the price axis and the time axis. Resizing the chart window changes the visual slope of the same price movement — a compressed view may show 52° while a stretched view of the same data shows 25°. The angle is a display artifact, not a market property. The Isotropic Coordinate System (ICS) addresses this by normalizing log-price by realized volatility (σ). In this space, the trend angle is designed to remain constant regardless of how the chart is displayed — because it measures price displacement in units of σ per bar, not in pixels per pixel.

🔷 HOW THE MODULES WORK TOGETHER

ST-EP06 operates as a deterministic pipeline where each stage consumes the output of the one before it:

Realized volatility estimation (σ) → Structural block construction → Monotonic direction detection → ICS angle measurement → Channel boundary fitting → Six-scale parallel analysis → Consensus aggregation → Breakout and retest state tracking → Dashboard narrative generation

The Yang-Zhang σ provides the normalization constant for every downstream computation. Price history is then partitioned into structural blocks, each distilled to a single central tendency that resists close-price bias. Consecutive block centers are compared to identify the longest uninterrupted directional segment. The slope of that segment, measured in σ-normalized space, yields the ICS angle. Four price extremes located within the segment define two log-linear channel boundaries. This complete pipeline runs independently at six temporal scales, and their independent outputs are aggregated into a structural consensus. A finite-state machine then tracks the evolving relationship between price and the primary channel — breakout, retest, confirmation, or failure — and translates it into a single-line human-readable narrative.

ST-EP06 operates as a deterministic sequential pipeline. Yang-Zhang volatility (σ) provides the normalization constant that flows into every downstream stage. Price history is partitioned into structural blocks, each reduced to a geometric mean. The longest monotonic segment determines direction, and its slope in σ-normalized space yields the ICS angle. Four price extremes define the channel boundaries. This complete pipeline runs independently at six scales — 3, 7, 13, 19, 29, and 47 bars per block — all prime numbers, chosen to minimize harmonic overlap so that multiple scales are unlikely to lock onto the same cyclical artifact. Scale 19 (highlighted) serves as the primary engine: it is the only scale that maps to the user's Trend Block Period input, and the only scale whose output drives the chart-overlay channel lines, the projection, the diamond markers, and the breakout/retest state machine. The other five scales operate at fixed periods and contribute exclusively to the cross-scale consensus count — providing structural context that a single scale cannot offer alone. When 5 or 6 of the 6 scales agree on direction, it suggests a structural trend visible across a broad range of temporal resolutions.

🔷 DATA ANCHORING

Every structural computation in ST-EP06 — volatility, block means, direction, channel coordinates, state machine transitions, and dashboard narrative — is governed by a single anchoring reference, selected through the Calculation Bar input.

Live Bar mode (default): the anchor is the current forming bar. Values update with each incoming tick. This is standard TradingView behavior and means the indicator may exhibit intra-bar repaint — the live bar's data enters all computations as it evolves.

Close Bar mode: the anchor shifts to the last fully confirmed (closed) bar. The forming bar is excluded from every computation. Values lock once a bar closes and do not change retroactively. This mode is intended for structural analysis, back-testing, and any workflow where historical consistency is a priority.

One deliberate exception is maintained in both modes: the dashboard header always displays the current live closing price (Live Exception protocol), preserving real-time price awareness regardless of how the indicator's structural engine is anchored.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/8q95ymSu/

Two modes, same chart moment. In Live Bar the anchor sits on the forming bar, so every value updates tick-by-tick and may repaint within the bar. In Close Bar the anchor shifts to the last closed bar, locking all structural values once the bar closes. The only exception is the dashboard header row, which always displays the live closing price in both modes, so real-time price awareness is never lost.

🔷 YANG-ZHANG VOLATILITY (σ)

The foundation of the ICS is a robust volatility estimate. ST-EP06 uses the Yang-Zhang (2000) realized volatility estimator, an academically established method that combines three variance components:

Overnight variance — capturing the gap between consecutive sessions, measured from the prior close to the current open.
Intraday variance — capturing the movement from open to close within each session.
Range-based variance — using the Rogers-Satchell (1991) estimator, which extracts additional information from the high and low prices without assuming zero drift.

These three components are blended using an optimal weight that is designed to minimize estimation error. The resulting σ updates every bar, adapts to changing market conditions, and — crucially — is drift-invariant: it is intended to remain unbiased whether the market is trending strongly or mean-reverting.

🔷 BLOCK CONSTRUCTION

Rather than analyzing individual bars, ST-EP06 partitions recent price history into consecutive non-overlapping blocks. Each block spans a user-defined number of bars (the Trend Block Period input) and is reduced to a single representative value: the geometric mean of the block's highest high and lowest low, computed in logarithmic space.

This log-midpoint serves as the block's central tendency. Unlike a simple average of closing prices, it captures the structural center of the entire price range within the block, avoiding bias toward any single price point. The number of consecutive blocks compared is controlled by the Trend Block Groups input — more groups means deeper lookback and the ability to detect longer structural trends.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/qZh43fQ3/

Price history is partitioned into consecutive non-overlapping blocks. Each block reduces to a single log-midpoint — the geometric mean of its highest high and lowest low. Connecting the midpoints forms the representative chain used for trend detection.

🔷 DIRECTION DETECTION + ICS ANGLE

Once blocks are constructed, the engine compares their geometric means in sequence, starting from the most recent. It identifies the longest consecutive segment where each block's central tendency moves in the same direction — either consistently rising or consistently falling. A single reversal terminates the segment.

The slope of this segment is then measured in ICS space: the logarithmic price difference between the oldest and newest blocks in the segment, divided by σ, divided by the number of bars between them. The arctangent of this normalized slope produces the ICS angle in degrees.

If the absolute angle falls within the Range Threshold (a user-configurable dead zone in degrees), the direction is classified as ranging rather than trending. This threshold acts as a sensitivity filter — wider values require steeper moves before declaring a trend, narrower values respond to subtler directional shifts.

An ICS angle of 45° indicates approximately one σ of price movement per bar. An angle near 0° suggests the market may be structurally flat. Because σ adjusts for volatility and the logarithm adjusts for price level, these angles are intended to be directly comparable across any instrument and any timeframe.

🔷 CHANNEL FITTING

Within the identified trending segment, the engine locates four price extremes: the highest high, the lowest high, the highest low, and the lowest low — each paired with its bar position. These four points define two linear boundaries in ICS space.

During an uptrend, the upper boundary is fitted through the lowest high and highest high (capturing the rising ceiling), while the lower boundary is fitted through the lowest low and highest low (capturing the rising floor). During a downtrend, the fitting order reverses to capture descending structure. During a ranging market, the channel uses horizontal boundaries at the segment's absolute high and low.

All boundary computations occur in the σ-normalized logarithmic coordinate system, meaning the channel lines represent geometric (log-linear) paths in price space — curves that naturally follow multiplicative price behavior rather than additive assumptions.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/e2bwgUF3/

Within the trending segment, four extremes — HH, LH, HL, LL — define two log-linear boundaries. In an uptrend, the upper line fits through LH and HH, the lower through LL and HL. The direction reverses the fitting order for downtrends, and a ranging market uses horizontal boundaries.

🔷 6-SCALE PARALLEL ANALYSIS

A single temporal scale may capture the trend at one resolution but miss structure at others. ST-EP06 runs the complete pipeline — volatility normalization, block construction, direction detection, ICS angle, and channel fitting — independently at six different scales: 3, 7, 13, 19, 29, and 47 bars per block. These values were chosen as prime numbers to minimize harmonic overlap between scales.

Scale 19 serves as the primary engine and maps to the user's Trend Block Period input. The other five scales use fixed periods, providing a structural context that the primary engine alone cannot offer.

The dashboard displays each scale's independent trend direction. A consensus count shows how many of the six scales agree: 5/6 or 6/6 agreement suggests a structural trend that is visible across multiple temporal resolutions, while low agreement may indicate transitional or conflicting structure.

🔷 BREAKOUT / RETEST STATE MACHINE

ST-EP06 includes a 5-state finite automaton that tracks price's structural relationship to the primary channel boundaries:

Inside — price is observed between the channel floor and ceiling. The dashboard shows the position as a percentage: distance from floor and distance to ceiling (summing to 100%).

Breakout Up / Breakout Down — price has exited above the ceiling or below the floor. The dashboard shows the breakout price and the percentage of channel width that price has moved beyond the boundary.

Retest Up / Retest Down — after a breakout, price has moved at least one σ away from the boundary (establishing distance), then returned to test it. The dashboard shows both the original breakout price and the current retest level.

Transitions between states use dynamic σ-based thresholds rather than fixed percentages, meaning the sensitivity automatically adjusts with market volatility. Additional flags track:

✓ Confirmed — a breakout that has been retested and bounced at least one σ away from the boundary.
(gap) — price crossed the entire channel width in a single transition.
Failed breakout — price re-entered the channel after initially breaking out.
Direction reset — the primary trend direction changed, wiping all breakout state.

🔷 VISUAL TOOLS

All chart-overlay elements are drawn from the primary engine (scale 19):

Channel lines — solid upper and lower boundaries from the segment start to the anchor bar, colored by trend direction (configurable up/down/range colors, width, and line style).

Projection lines — dotted forward extension of the channel slopes beyond the anchor bar, providing a visual reference for potential future support and resistance. The projection offset, width, and style are independently configurable.

Channel fill — semi-transparent shading between channel boundaries, with independent color selection and adjustable transparency. Applies to both the solid channel and projection segments.

Diamond markers (◆) — placed at the channel endpoints on the anchor bar. Hovering reveals a tooltip with the anchored close price, ceiling level, floor level, and the price's position as a percentage of channel width.

Direction label — positioned at the midpoint between segment start and projection end. Displays the trend arrow, direction text, and ICS angle (e.g., "▲ UP +7.3°"). Tooltip includes block count.

🔷 DASHBOARD

A compact information table appears at the top-right corner of the chart, organized in 5 rows:

Header — indicator name, ticker symbol, timeframe, and live price (always live under the Live Exception protocol, even in Close Bar mode).

Period — the six scale values (3, 7, 13, user's period, 29, 47) displayed across columns. The primary engine column is highlighted.

Trend — per-scale trend direction with directional arrows (▲ UP, ▼ DN, ◈ RNG) and color coding.

Agreement — consensus count (e.g., "5/6 UP") with the primary channel ceiling (▲) and floor (▼) price levels.

Narrative — a single merged row presenting the breakout/retest state machine output as a human-readable sentence with distance measurements. This row updates dynamically as price interacts with the channel.

All dashboard text, tooltips, and narrative phrases are fully localized.

🔷 ALERT CONDITIONS

ST-EP06 provides 19 alert conditions organized in 5 categories, all gated by a master Enable Alerts toggle:

D · Direction (3 alerts) — fires when the primary engine trend changes to uptrend, downtrend, or range.

B · Breakout (4 alerts) — fires on initial breakout above ceiling or below floor, and separately on confirmed breakout (retested and bounced).

R · Retest (2 alerts) — fires when price returns to test the boundary after establishing distance.

S · Structural (5 alerts) — fires on gap-through events (price crosses entire channel), failed breakouts (price re-enters channel), and direction resets (trend change wipes state).

A · Agreement (5 alerts) — fires when cross-scale consensus reaches significant thresholds: full bullish (6/6), strong bullish (5/6), full bearish (6/6), strong bearish (5/6), or range consensus (≥4/6).

Important: alerts require Calculation Bar = Live Bar. In Close Bar mode, all alert conditions are automatically suppressed and a visual warning is displayed on the chart — because Close Bar mode intentionally lags by one bar, which is semantically incompatible with live alert delivery.

🔷 LANGUAGE SUPPORT

The dashboard, all tooltips, the breakout/retest narrative, and the alert warning label are available in 7 languages:

English · Türkçe · العربية · Русский · Italiano · Português (BR) · 中文

Select the preferred language from the Language dropdown in the Display settings group. All structural and numerical outputs remain unchanged — only the display language of text elements is affected.

🔷 HOW TO USE

Apply ST-EP06 to any chart — the indicator is designed to work across instruments (equities, forex, crypto, commodities, indices) and timeframes without parameter re-optimization, because the ICS framework normalizes for volatility and price level automatically.

Start with the default settings (Period 26, Groups 5, Sigma Length 20) and observe how the channel captures the dominant structural trend. The 6-scale consensus in the dashboard may help assess whether the observed trend is isolated to one temporal resolution or confirmed across multiple scales.

The Calculation Bar setting is a structural decision: use Live Bar for real-time monitoring and alert-driven workflows; use Close Bar for analysis and back-testing where historical stability is prioritized.

The ICS angle on the direction label provides a quantitative measure of trend intensity. Comparing angles across different instruments or timeframes is one of the intended use cases of the ICS framework — a 15° angle on one chart and a 15° angle on another may suggest similar structural momentum relative to each market's own volatility.

The breakout/retest narrative in the dashboard bottom row is designed to provide context-rich status updates without requiring manual chart reading. The σ-based thresholds ensure that breakout sensitivity adapts to current market conditions rather than relying on fixed values.

// PURPOSE:
//   Multi-scale structural trend channel indicator built on an Isotropic
//   Coordinate System (ICS). ICS normalizes log-price by Yang-Zhang volatility σ,
//   producing a dimensionless space where trend angles are comparable across
//   instruments, timeframes, and volatility regimes.
//
// METHODOLOGY:
//   1. Yang-Zhang (2000) realized volatility estimator provides drift-invariant σ
//      using Open-Close overnight variance, Close-Open intraday variance, and
//      Rogers-Satchell range-based variance with optimal k-weight.
//   2. Block Construction: price history is partitioned into consecutive blocks of
//      length = Period. Each block reduces to a geometric mean (log-midpoint of
//      High/Low), capturing the block's central tendency without close-price bias.
//   3. Direction Detection: consecutive block geometric means are compared to find
//      the longest monotonic segment. Direction = sign of the slope across that
//      segment. The ICS angle (arctan of normalized slope) classifies the move as
//      trending or ranging against the Range Threshold input.
//   4. Channel Fitting: within the trending segment, the four price extremes
//      (highest high, lowest high, highest low, lowest low) with their bar indices
//      define two linear boundaries — upper and lower channel lines — via point-
//      to-point slope interpolation. FLAT channels use horizontal extremes.
//   5. 6-Scale Parallel Analysis: the full pipeline (steps 1–4) runs independently
//      at scales 3, 7, 13, 19, 29, 47. Scale 19 = primary engine (uses the user's
//      Period input). Other scales use fixed periods for cross-scale consensus.
//   6. Breakout / Retest State Machine: a 5-state system (INSIDE, BO_UP, RT_UP,
//      BO_DN, RT_DN) on the primary channel tracks price exits, σ-distance
//      thresholds, retest events, gap crossings, and direction resets.
//
// ANTI-REPAINT:
//   Configurable via the Calculation Bar input (default Live Bar). Close
//   Bar mode anchors every structural computation at bar [1] — the live
//   bar never enters direction, channel, or state machine logic. Live Bar
//   mode anchors at bar [0] and repaints with each tick. Dashboard header
//   price stays live in both modes (Live Exception). Visual elements draw
//   only at barstate.islast or barstate.islastconfirmedhistory.
//
// VISUAL OUTPUT:
//   - Channel lines (solid) with forward projection (dotted)
//   - Linefill between channel boundaries (independent colors + transparency)
//   - Diamond markers (◆) at channel endpoints with context tooltip
//     (close at selected anchor, ceiling, floor, extension %)
//   - Direction + ICS angle label at channel midpoint
//   - Dashboard table: periods, per-scale trend, consensus, channel levels,
//     and a human-readable narrative row summarizing breakout/retest state

// PRIMARY — Block Construction
//
// PURPOSE:
//   Partitions recent price history into consecutive non-overlapping blocks of
//   length i_period. Each block reduces to three summary values: geometric mean
//   of High/Low (central tendency), block High, and block Low. These summaries
//   feed the direction detection and channel fitting stages downstream.
//
// METHOD:
//   For each block i (0 = newest, i_groups−1 = oldest):
//     offset   = _anchor + i × i_period    — anchored at user's Calculation Bar
//     blockHi  = ta.highest(high, i_period) at [offset]
//     blockLo  = ta.lowest(low, i_period)   at [offset]
//     geoMean  = exp((ln(blockHi) + ln(blockLo)) / 2)  — log-midpoint
//     centerX  = bar_index − offset − floor(i_period / 2) — temporal center
//   Geometric mean avoids close-price bias and is symmetric in log-space,
//   making it the natural midpoint for ICS-based slope computation.
//
// ANTI-REPAINT:
//   Offsets start at _anchor (offset = _anchor + i × period). In Close Bar
//   mode (_anchor = 1) bar [0] is never accessed; in Live Bar mode (_anchor
//   = 0) the live bar enters directly — standard repaint behavior.
//   max_bars_back() ensures sufficient history for deep lookbacks.

// PRIMARY — Direction + ICS Angle + Channel Fitting
//
// PURPOSE:
//   Determines the trend direction from block geometric means, computes the ICS
//   angle that quantifies trend strength in normalized space, and fits two linear
//   channel boundaries (upper + lower) through the trending segment's extremes.
//
// METHOD — Direction Detection:
//   Compare consecutive block geometric means to find the longest monotonic
//   segment starting from the newest block. Direction = sign of the first pair.
//   The segment extends as long as each subsequent pair agrees with the initial
//   direction. A single disagreement terminates the segment.
//
// METHOD — ICS Angle:
//   Compute the slope in ICS space between the oldest and newest block
//   geometric means (central tendencies of the first and last blocks in the
//   monotonic segment):
//     slope_ics = (ln(gNew) − ln(gOld)) / σ / (xNew − xOld)   [σ per bar]
//     angle     = arctan(slope_ics) × 180° / π                [range (−90°, +90°)]
//   If |angle| ≤ Range Threshold → direction overridden to DIR_FLAT.
//   45° means price is moving at 1σ per bar in log-space — scale-invariant.
//
// METHOD — Channel Fitting:
//   Within the trending segment, locate 4 price extremes with bar indices:
//     HH (highest high), LH (lowest high), HL (highest low), LL (lowest low)
//   UP trend:   upper line through (xLH, fLH) and (xHH, fHH) in ICS
//               lower line through (xLL, fLL) and (xHL, fHL) in ICS
//   DOWN trend: upper line through (xHH, fHH) and (xLH, fLH) in ICS
//               lower line through (xHL, fHL) and (xLL, fLL) in ICS
//   FLAT:       horizontal lines at HH and LL (zero slope)
//   All lines are fitted in ICS via f_icsLine (log-linear in price) and
//   extrapolated to bar_index − _anchor. σ cancels in channel values.

// 6-SCALE TREND FUNCTIONS
//
// PURPOSE:
//   Reusable function pair that encapsulates the complete trend analysis pipeline
//   (block construction → direction → ICS angle → channel fitting) for any
//   arbitrary period. Enables the 6-scale parallel analysis by calling f_compute()
//   once per scale with different period parameters.
//
// FUNCTIONS:
//   f_analyze(gm, hi, lo, cx, groups, thresh, sig) → TrendResult
//     Core algorithm: identical logic to the PRIMARY section above, but
//     parameterized to accept pre-built block arrays. Produces a complete
//     TrendResult with direction, angle, segment length, and channel levels.
//
//   f_compute(hhSer, llSer, per, grp, thr, sig) → TrendResult
//     Wrapper: builds block arrays from ta.highest/ta.lowest series at the
//     given period, then delegates to f_analyze(). Handles the early-bar
//     guard (bar_index >= grp × per + _anchor) and returns default
//     TrendResult when insufficient history is available.
//
// DESIGN NOTE:
//   The two-function split (compute + analyze) avoids duplicating the block
//   construction loop inside f_analyze, keeping the core algorithm testable
//   with externally provided arrays.
//
// DEPENDENCIES:
//   Reads: hhSer, llSer (via [] operator), bar_index
//   Writes: returns TrendResult (no global state mutation)
//   Consumed by: 6-SCALE HH/LL SERIES + COMPUTATION + CONSENSUS

// 6-SCALE — HH/LL Series + Computation + Consensus
//
// PURPOSE:
//   Instantiates the 6-scale parallel analysis. Each scale (3,7,13,19,29,47)
//   gets its own ta.highest / ta.lowest series and a f_compute() call that
//   produces an independent TrendResult. Scale 19 reuses the PRIMARY engine
//   result to avoid redundant computation. The 6 TrendResults are then
//   aggregated into a consensus count for the dashboard.
//
// METHOD:
//   1. Pre-compute 12 series: ta.highest(high, N) and ta.lowest(low, N) for
//      each N ∈ {3, 7, 13, 19, 29, 47}. max_bars_back(500) on each series
//      ensures deep lookback availability for all grouping combinations.
//   2. Call f_compute() for scales 3, 7, 13, 29, 47 with the shared [_anchor]-anchored σ.
//      Scale 19 is assigned directly from PRIMARY engine (_dir, _ang, etc.).
//   3. Consensus: count how many of the 6 scales vote for each direction.
//      _cUp = bullish, _cDn = bearish, _cFlat = ranging (all three counted).
//      Dashboard shows the winning direction with its own matching count.
//
// ANTI-REPAINT:
//   All f_compute() calls use the [_anchor]-anchored sigma via _trSig. Channel
//   extrapolation inside f_analyze uses bar_index − _anchor. ta.highest /
//   ta.lowest series are unshifted here — the anchor shift happens inside
//   f_compute() via the offset = _anchor + i × period formula. Close Bar
//   mode (_anchor = 1) excludes the live bar; Live Bar mode (_anchor = 0)
//   includes it with standard repaint behavior.

// BREAKOUT / RETEST STATE MACHINE (primary engine, scale 19)
//
// PURPOSE:
//   Tracks the structural relationship between price and the primary channel
//   boundaries using a 5-state finite automaton. Produces human-readable status
//   labels and distance measurements for the dashboard narrative row.
//
// STATES (directed graph):
//   ST_INSIDE (0)  — price within [chLower, chUpper]
//   ST_BO_UP  (+1) — price broke above chUpper (extPos > 1.0)
//   ST_RT_UP  (+2) — price retesting chUpper after upward breakout
//   ST_BO_DN  (−1) — price broke below chLower (extPos < 0.0)
//   ST_RT_DN  (−2) — price retesting chLower after downward breakout
//
// TRANSITIONS:
//   INSIDE → BO_UP:  extPos > 1.0 (price exits above ceiling)
//   INSIDE → BO_DN:  extPos < 0.0 (price exits below floor)
//   BO_UP  → RT_UP:  boDistanced (moved ≥1σ away) AND distUp < 1σ (returning)
//   BO_UP  → INSIDE: extPos ≤ 1.0 (failed breakout, re-entered channel)
//   BO_UP  → BO_DN:  extPos < 0.0 (gap: crossed entire channel)
//   RT_UP  → BO_UP:  distUp ≥ 1σ (bounced off retest → confirmed breakout)
//   RT_UP  → INSIDE: extPos ≤ 1.0 (retest failed, re-entered channel)
//   (Mirror transitions for DN states)
//   Direction change → full reset to INSIDE with _retFrom flag.
//
// FLAGS:
//   _boConfirm   — true when breakout has been retested and bounced (confirmed)
//   _boDistanced — true when price moved ≥1σ from channel before retest eligible
//   _boGapped    — true when price crossed the entire channel in one transition
//   _boPrice     — price level where the breakout occurred
//   _rtPrice     — price level where the retest touched
//   _retFrom     — direction of the failed breakout (+1 or −1) when returning INSIDE
//   _dirReset    — true on the bar where direction changed (full state wipe)
//
// σ THRESHOLD:
//   Distance from channel boundary is measured in Yang-Zhang σ units:
//     dist = |ln(close[_anchor]) − ln(boundary)| / σ
//   The 1σ threshold is dynamic — self-adjusts with market volatility.
//   No fixed-point input required from the user.
//
// ANTI-REPAINT:
//   All inputs anchor at [_anchor]: close[_anchor], _chUp, _chLo, sigma.
//   State variables are var-declared (persistent) and update once per bar.
//   In Close Bar mode (_anchor = 1) extPos uses close[1] and the live bar
//   cannot trigger transitions. In Live Bar mode (_anchor = 0) extPos uses

// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// VISUALIZATION — Channel + Projection + Markers + Label
//
// PURPOSE:
//   Renders all chart-overlay visual elements from the primary engine (scale 19)
//   results. Executes only on the final bar (barstate.islastconfirmedhistory or
//   barstate.islast) to minimize drawing object churn.
//
// VISUAL ELEMENTS:
//   1. Channel Lines (solid): upper + lower boundaries from segment start (sLx)
//      to the anchor bar (bar_index − _anchor). Color follows direction via f_dClr().
//      Width and style are user-configurable inputs.
//   2. Projection Lines (dotted): forward extension of channel slopes by
//      i_pjOff bars beyond the anchor. Same color as channel, independent
//      width and style inputs. Gives the trader a visual forward reference.
//   3. Linefill: semi-transparent fill between channel lines and between
//      projection lines. Uses independent fill colors (f_fClr) and
//      user-controlled transparency (i_fillTr). Toggled by i_showFill.
//   4. Diamond Markers (◆): placed at channel endpoints (anchor bar) on both
//      upper and lower boundaries. Tooltip shows Close[_anchor] (label reflects
//      mode), Ch▲, Ch▼, and Ext% (price position as percentage of channel width).
//   5. Direction Label: positioned at the midpoint between segment start and
//      projection end. Shows direction arrow + ICS angle (e.g. "▲ UP +7.3°").
//      Tooltip includes trend direction, angle, and block count.
//
// LIFECYCLE:
//   All drawing objects (lines, linefills, labels) are var-declared and deleted
//   at the start of each render cycle, then recreated from current data.
//   This ensures exactly one set of visuals exists at any time — no orphans.
//
// ANTI-REPAINT:
//   Channel coordinates use [_anchor]-anchored values (_chUp, _chLo from
//   PRIMARY). Anchor bar = bar_index − _anchor. Projection extends forward
//   from the anchor. All slope computations use the segment's own extreme
//   coordinates. Tooltip shows close[_anchor] with a dynamic label that
//   reflects the user's Calculation Bar selection.
//
// DEPENDENCIES:
//   Reads: _dir, _ang, _seg, _chUp, _chLo (PRIMARY), _bHi, _bLo, _bCx (BLOCKS),
//          _trSig (6-SCALE shared σ), _anchor (ANCHOR RESOLVER),
//          close[_anchor] (marker tooltip price), _L (active I18n instance),
//          i_showCh, i_showFill, i_chW, i_chSty, i_pjOff, i_pjW, i_pjSty,
//          i_clrUp/Dn/Rng, i_fillUp/Dn/Rng, i_fillTr, i_dashSz (inputs)
//   Writes: _upLn, _loLn, _upPj, _loPj (lines), _chFill, _pjFill (linefills),
//           _mkUp, _mkLo (marker labels), _lbl (direction label)
//   Consumed by: chart overlay (visual output only, no downstream data)

    //   Renders a compact information table (position.top_right) summarizing
    //   the primary engine output and 6-scale consensus for the trader.
    //   All values anchor at [_anchor] (user's Calculation Bar selection) except
    //   the header row, which always displays live close under the Live Exception
    //   protocol — preserved in both modes for real-time awareness.
    //
    // LAYOUT (7 columns × 5 rows after narrative migration):
    //   Row 0: Header — indicator name, ticker, timeframe, live price
    //   Row 1: Periods — fixed scale labels (3, 7, 13, 29, 47) with column
    //          four showing the user's Period input
    //   Row 2: Trend — per-scale direction arrows (▲/▼/◈) with colors
    //   Row 3: Agreement — consensus count + direction + Ch▲ + Ch▼ levels
    //   Row 4: Narrative — localized breakout/retest state + distance,
    //          merged across all 7 columns
    //
    // NARRATIVE ROW:
    //   Row 4 joins the state label (stLine1) and the distance descriptor
    //   (stLine2) with " · " into a single merged cell spanning all 7
    //   columns. Text color (stClr) and content are selected by the
    //   current _boState via a switch expression. Distance percentages
    //   (_flPct, _clPct, _abPct, _blPct) are derived from _extPos and

//   Isotropic Coordinate System (ICS): y = log(price) / σ — a dimensionless price
//   space where trend angles and distances are scale-invariant across instruments,
//   timeframes, and volatility regimes. Six parallel scales, σ-normalized slopes,
//   log-linear channel fitting, configurable anti-repaint via Calculation Bar.
//
// PHILOSOPHY:
//   Structure over price. Log over linear. Evidence over intuition.
//
// DISCLAIMER:
//   Educational and analytical tool. Not financial advice. Historical patterns
//   do not guarantee future outcomes.

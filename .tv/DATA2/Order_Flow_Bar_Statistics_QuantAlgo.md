# Order Flow Bar Statistics [QuantAlgo]

Source: https://www.tradingview.com/script/kByFhbit-Order-Flow-Bar-Statistics-QuantAlgo/

## Description

🟢 Overview

The Order Flow Bar Statistics is a per bar order flow table built for traders who want to see how a candle formed rather than just where it closed. It reads the order flow data TradingView makes available for the symbol you are charting and lays it out row by row: volume by aggressor side, delta, liquidations, open interest, positioning, funding, and closing price. Whether you are zoomed out reading months of activity as a heat map or studying the last few bars figure by figure, the table gives you a structured view of what took place inside each candle instead of a single volume number.

*Note: This indicator uses TradingView volume footprint data, which is available on Premium and Ultimate plans only.

🟢 What Are Bar Statistics?

A candle tells you where price opened, closed, and how far it traveled. However, it tells you nothing about who did the trading. Two bars can close identically while one was driven by aggressive buyers lifting the offer and the other by patient limit orders absorbing supply. Order flow statistics separate those cases.

The core distinction is the aggressor: the side that crossed the spread to get filled. Aggressive buy volume is the portion of a bar that traded into the offer. Aggressive sell volume traded into the bid. The difference between them is delta, and delta read against price movement is where most of the insight lives. Layered on top of that, liquidations show where leverage was forcibly closed, open interest shows whether positions were opened or unwound, and funding shows which side is paying to hold its exposure. Together these describe the mechanics underneath a price move rather than just its outcome.

🟢 How It Works

The indicator assembles each bar's statistics from the data TradingView provides for your symbol and lays them out as a grid. The aggressor split and delta come from volume footprint data. Total volume and closing price come from the charted contract itself. Liquidations, open interest, and funding come from the companion data feeds TradingView publishes for supported derivative contracts. Net Long and Net Short are derived from delta and open interest.

Every row reads from the symbol you are charting, and which rows populate depends on what TradingView publishes for it. Rows with no data available read as N/A.

Rendering happens in two layers. The color layer covers every bar the chart holds, giving you the long range view. The number layer prints figures on the most recent bars for close reading. Each cell is shaded relative to the largest reading its own row produced across a configurable lookback, so intensity reads against recent conditions rather than a fixed scale that would go flat on quiet symbols.

🟢 Key Features

▶ The Statistics

Volume and delta: Buy Volume, Sell Volume, Total Volume, Delta Volume, and Percent Delta. Buy and sell reconcile to total, and Percent Delta normalizes the imbalance so bars of very different size stay directly comparable.

Liquidations: Buy Liquidations, Sell Liquidations, Total Liquidations, and Delta Liquidations. These show forced position closures split by side, with a net figure isolating which side wore the damage when both are firing at once.
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/tk7SLofK/[/image]
Positioning: Open Interest change, Net Long, and Net Short. Net Long plus Net Short reconciles back to delta, and Net Long minus Net Short reconciles back to the open interest change, so the pair ties to both inputs and can be checked against the rows above it.

Context: Funding Rate and Close Price. Funding shows the rate in force during the bar, and the closing price keeps the table self contained so you can read a full bar of order flow without moving your eye back to the candles.

▶ Two Rendering Layers

Turn numbers off and the table becomes a pure heat map spanning the full chart. At that zoom, shifts in funding, open interest, and liquidation activity become visible as blocks of color rather than individual readings, which may help identify when market character changed. Turn numbers back on and you have the figures on recent bars for close analysis of individual candles.
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/LHSo4S3a/[/image]
▶ Delta Engine

The aggressor split has four modes. Bid/ask engine reads TradingView volume footprint data. Bid/ask engine with estimate falls back to a range based approximation on bars that data does not cover, keeping the row continuous and flagging estimated cells with a tilde on the row tag. Estimate from bar range works purely from where each bar closed within its range, which can be useful on symbols or periods where footprint coverage is thin. Off leaves the delta rows out entirely, leaving a table of liquidations, open interest, funding, and volume.
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/d4Rmj3q7/[/image]
▶ Liquidation Naming

Liquidation rows can be named by either convention, because the two are mirror images of each other. A long being closed out fires a market sell, and a short being closed out fires a market buy. Liquidated position side names a long being wiped out as a buy liquidation, since buyers were the side liquidated. Resulting order side names the same event as a sell. The underlying data is identical either way, only the labels swap.
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/MVAxUcra/[/image]
▶ Zero and Unavailable Are Distinct

A cell prints 0 when the feed is live and the value for that bar is zero. When TradingView has no data for that row on your symbol, or none for a particular bar, the cell reads N/A and the row name tag dims. Reading the two apart matters, because a bar with no liquidations and a symbol with no liquidation data are different situations. Rows built from two inputs, such as Net Long and Net Short, read as N/A when either input is missing.
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/lNVuDmCw/[/image]
▶ Row Tooltips

Every row name tag carries a tooltip explaining what that statistic measures and how to interpret it. Dimmed tags state that the data is not available for the ticker you are charting.
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/R4605tGD/[/image]
▶ Number Format and Display

Figures keep their decimals rather than being rounded off. Abbreviation carries the decimals through the conversion, so a value reads as 73.95K rather than 74K, and can be switched off to print everything in full. Decimal precision adapts to magnitude by default or can be fixed to a set count. Display Mode reports volume, delta, liquidations, and open interest either in base units of the contract or converted to quote currency notional for comparison across assets and across time.
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/z8acciHV/[/image]
▶ Color Presets and Automatic Contrast

Six color schemes are included: Classic, Aqua, Cosmic, Cyber, Neon, and Custom with full control over bullish, bearish, and zero colors. Text color inside every cell is calculated from the cell shade using relative luminance, so figures stay legible on any scheme, any custom color, and at any intensity without manual adjustment.
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/fablxIy6/[/image]
▶ Alerts

Twenty eight built in alert conditions, two for every row. Magnitude rows offer Rising and Falling. Signed rows offer Turns Positive and Turns Negative, since a zero cross is the meaningful event for delta, liquidation delta, open interest, and net positioning.

🟢 Examples

A few patterns worth watching:

1. Price up, Delta positive, Open Interest up: aggressive buying alongside new contracts entering. This may suggest genuine participation behind the move rather than a squeeze, which some traders read as more sustainable than a rally driven purely by covering.
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/vRhosOEe/[/image]
2. Price up, Delta negative or flat, Open Interest down: the move may be shorts covering rather than fresh buying. These sequences can produce fast price movement while having less durable positioning behind them.
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/wCo55M7Z/[/image]
3. Large Delta with little price movement: aggressive orders appear to be meeting resting liquidity. Absorption of this kind often shows up near the end of a directional push, and may indicate the aggressive side is running out of room.
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/tAYRJqzy/[/image]
4. Liquidation spike with Open Interest falling sharply: forced deleveraging rather than new positioning. Clusters here mark where leverage was flushed, and once that leverage is gone there may be fewer participants left to force out in the same direction.
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/E6rmLg0E/[/image]
5. Funding elevated and holding, with Open Interest high: one side is paying a persistent cost to maintain crowded exposure. This does not time a reversal on its own, but it may raise the odds that a move against that side accelerates once it starts.
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/bhNpP2eG/[/image]
6. Percent Delta clustering with the same sign across consecutive bars: sustained pressure rather than a single aggressive print. Isolated large readings are common, runs of them are less so and may carry more information.
[image]https://www.tradingview.com/x/D9k3orfz/[/image]
Remember that every long is matched to a short. Rising open interest during a downtrend does not mean only shorts are entering, it means positions on both sides are being opened. Delta is what distinguishes which side was acting aggressively, which is why the two rows are more useful read together than apart.

🟢 Important Notes

1. This indicator uses TradingView volume footprint data. That data is available on Premium and Ultimate plans only, and the requirement applies to the whole script rather than to individual rows, so the table will not render on other plans regardless of which statistics are enabled.

2. The statistics included here are those TradingView currently exposes to Pine scripts for most supported symbols. Order flow coverage on TradingView continues to expand, and further statistics may be added in future updates as new per bar data becomes accessible to scripts. Where a metric you use elsewhere is absent, it is because a per bar feed for it is not yet available to Pine rather than a design choice.

3. TradingView reconstructs which side was the aggressor rather than reading an exchange taker flag directly. Buy and sell reconcile to total volume, while the split itself may differ from other data sources. The direction of delta is generally the more dependable part of the reading, and the exact split is best treated as indicative. Footprint coverage also thins on older bars, so those rows may go blank when scrolled far back.

4. Liquidation, open interest, and funding data is published by TradingView for crypto derivatives on a number of exchanges, such as Binance, Bybit, and OKX. Coverage is decided per feed and per venue, so a contract can be fully tradable and still have no companion data, in which case those rows read as unavailable.

5. Liquidation values may arrive in base or quote currency depending on the venue and derivative. Read magnitudes against the past behavior of the same symbol rather than comparing them directly across exchanges.

6. On spot pairs, equities, indices, and other symbols with no derivative data, the volume and delta rows still function while the liquidation, open interest, and funding rows report as unavailable. Those three are properties of derivative contracts and have no equivalent in a spot market, so the indicator reports them as unavailable. Funding applies only to perpetual contracts, since dated futures converge through basis instead.

7. Printed figures are drawn with label objects, which TradingView caps at 500 per script shared across every enabled row. With every row enabled, the ceiling is 34 numbered bars. Color is unaffected and spans the full chart. Switching rows off buys more numbered columns.

8. Bar Replay can report a memory limit error. Volume footprint data loads across the full chart and cannot be capped by bar count, so on charts carrying a lot of history it can exceed the memory a script is allotted while replay is running. Whether you encounter it depends on how much history the chart holds, and replaying on a higher timeframe or a symbol with shorter history reduces the load. Normal charting is unaffected.

9. Order flow is most useful as a context layer rather than a standalone signal. Reading these statistics alongside price structure, market context, and your own risk management may help you assess whether a move is backed by new positioning or driven by unwinding, which could have meaningful implications for how far it extends and how quickly it might reverse.

10. Every data request uses the chart's own timeframe with lookahead disabled, and each bar's figures and shading are calculated from that bar and the ones before it, so a bar that has closed does not change afterward. The bar currently forming updates as it forms, as it does in any indicator reading live price or volume, so treat the rightmost column as provisional until that bar closes. Set alerts to trigger Once Per Bar Close if you want them evaluated on completed bars only.

tooltip_buy_vol     = 'Aggressive buy volume: the share of the bar that traded into the offer, where the buyer crossed the spread to get filled. This comes from volume footprint data, so it reflects which side initiated each trade rather than being inferred from the bar range. Reading footprint data requires a Premium or Ultimate plan. On charts carrying a lot of history it can also lead to a memory limit error in Bar Replay, since footprint data loads across the full chart and cannot be capped by bar count.\n\nHow to read it: rising buy volume alongside rising price is participation confirming the move. Heavy buy volume against a price that will not advance is absorption, buyers are being met by resting supply, and that often precedes a stall.\n\nIf cells read as unavailable, bid/ask data is not being served for those bars. Delta Engine under Data Source controls what happens in that case.'
tooltip_sell_vol    = 'Aggressive sell volume: the share of the bar that traded into the bid, where the seller crossed the spread to get filled.\n\nHow to read it: buy and sell volume always sum to total volume, so read them as a pair. A bar split close to evenly is a balanced auction. A lopsided split shows one side doing the work, and the direction of price against that split tells you whether they are being rewarded or absorbed.\n\nIf cells read as unavailable, bid/ask data is not being served for those bars.'
tooltip_total_vol   = 'Total traded volume for the bar, read directly from the charted contract.\n\nHow to read it: volume is conviction. A breakout on expanding volume carries weight, the same move on thin volume is far easier to reverse. Turn on Tint Total By Delta under Visual Settings and this row is colored by which side dominated, so magnitude and direction read together in one cell.\n\nBlank cells mean the symbol reports no volume at all, which is uncommon outside index and synthetic tickers.'
tooltip_delta_vol   = 'Net delta: aggressive buy volume minus aggressive sell volume. Positive means buyers lifted more than sellers hit.\n\nHow to read it: divergence between delta and price is the tell worth waiting for. Price making a new high while delta shrinks means the push is being sold into. A large delta that fails to move price means the aggressor is being absorbed by resting orders, which frequently marks the turn.\n\nBlank cells mean the buy and sell split was unavailable for that bar, so the subtraction has no inputs.'
tooltip_pct_delta   = 'Delta as a percentage of classified volume, so bars of very different size stay directly comparable.\n\nHow to read it: this normalizes conviction. Forty percent on a quiet bar is a more one-sided tape than a larger raw delta on a heavy bar. Clusters of same-sign readings across consecutive bars mark sustained pressure rather than a single aggressive print.\n\nBlank cells mean the buy and sell split was unavailable for that bar.'

tooltip_liq_naming  = 'Sets which side a liquidation row is named after. The two conventions are mirror images, because a long being closed out fires a market sell and a short being closed out fires a market buy.\n\nLiquidated position side: a long being wiped out counts as a BUY liquidation, since buyers were the side liquidated. This is how most order-flow desks read it and is the default.\n\nResulting order side: the same event counts as a SELL, since a market sell hit the book.\n\nThe underlying data is identical either way. Only the labels swap.'
tooltip_buy_liq     = 'Forced closure of long positions, sized in contract units. Under the default naming, buyers are the side being liquidated.\n\nHow to read it: liquidations are leverage being flushed, and they arrive as forced market selling. Clusters print at local lows and frequently mark exhaustion, because once the leveraged longs are gone there is nobody left to force out. Size matters far more than frequency, one large liquidation moves price more than many small ones.\n\nValues may arrive in base or quote currency depending on the venue, so read magnitudes against the past behavior of this symbol rather than comparing them across exchanges. A 0 means the feed is live and nothing was liquidated in that bar. Cells reading unavailable mean this data is not available for the charted ticker.'
tooltip_sell_liq    = 'Forced closure of short positions, sized in contract units. Under the default naming, sellers are the side being liquidated.\n\nHow to read it: this is squeeze fuel. Short liquidations arrive as forced market buying, so a cascade here accelerates upside moves and often produces the vertical segment of a rally. Pair it with open interest, a squeeze that drops open interest is covering rather than fresh buying, and tends to fade.\n\nA 0 means the feed is live and nothing was liquidated. Unavailable means this data is not available for the charted ticker.'
tooltip_total_liq   = 'Combined liquidation volume for the bar, both sides together.\n\nHow to read it: this is a pure stress gauge for when magnitude matters more than direction. Spikes mark the moments the market forced positions out, which are the bars worth revisiting when you review a session. Read it against the delta liquidation row to see which side wore the damage.\n\nA 0 means the feed is live and nothing was liquidated. Unavailable means this data is not available for the charted ticker.'
tooltip_delta_liq   = 'Net liquidation pressure: buy liquidations minus sell liquidations.\n\nHow to read it: when both sides are firing at once, this isolates who is actually being hurt. A large positive reading is longs being flushed, negative is shorts being squeezed. A sign flip mid-trend often marks the handover from one side capitulating to the other.\n\nA 0 means the feed is live and the two sides cancelled out. Unavailable means this data is not available for the charted ticker.'

tooltip_oi          = 'Bar-over-bar change in open interest, the total number of contracts outstanding.\n\nHow to read it: this separates new money from unwinding, and it is the single most useful row to pair with price. Price up with open interest up is fresh longs. Price up with open interest down is shorts covering, which is less durable. Price down with open interest up is fresh shorts. Price down with open interest down is longs closing out.\n\nCells reading unavailable mean this data is not available for the charted ticker.'
tooltip_net_long    = 'Net long participation for the bar, derived from delta and the change in open interest together.\n\nHow to read it: delta alone tells you who was aggressive, open interest alone tells you whether positions grew. Combining them separates aggressive buying that opened new longs from aggressive buying that merely closed shorts. A strongly positive reading is fresh long exposure entering.\n\nThis row needs both delta and open interest. If either is unavailable for the symbol the row reads unavailable rather than defaulting to zero, since a missing input is not the same as a zero result.'
tooltip_net_short   = 'Net short participation for the bar, derived from delta and the change in open interest together.\n\nHow to read it: net long plus net short always reconciles to delta, and net long minus net short reconciles to the open interest change, so the pair ties back to both inputs and can be checked against the rows above. Read the two together, both positive means both sides added exposure into the bar.\n\nThis row needs both delta and open interest. If either is unavailable the row reads unavailable rather than zero.'

tooltip_funding     = 'The funding rate in force during the bar, shown as a percentage. Funding is the periodic payment between longs and shorts that keeps a perpetual contract tethered to spot.\n\nHow to read it: positive funding means longs are paying shorts, so the crowd sits long and pays to stay there. Persistently elevated funding is a crowded trade and raises the odds of a long squeeze. Negative funding flips the payment and often marks pessimistic positioning near lows. Funding settles on the exchange interval, usually every eight hours, so the row holds flat between settlements by design.\n\nCells reading unavailable mean this data is not available for the charted ticker.'
tooltip_close       = 'The closing price of the charted contract for each bar, read straight from the chart.\n\nHow to read it: this keeps the table self-contained. You can scan a full bar of order flow with its price in the same row of cells, without moving your eye back to the candles above. The cell is colored by the bar-over-bar change, so the row doubles as a compact price direction strip running beneath the statistics.'
tooltip_fr_scale    = 'Unit conversion applied to the funding feed.\n\nDecimal to percent: the feed publishes a decimal fraction, so 0.0001 displays as 0.0100%. This is correct for the major perpetual venues and is the right choice for virtually every symbol.\n\nAuto: sorts every bar in the history into a magnitude bucket and applies whichever scale fits the majority, so one unusual bar cannot skew the whole chart.\n\nAlready percent and Basis points cover venues that publish on a different unit. If the funding row looks off by a factor of 100 or 10000, this is the setting to change.'
tooltip_fr_heat     = 'Controls what the funding cell color is measured against.\n\nLevel: colors each cell by the funding rate itself. When funding sits pinned at one value the row becomes a flat saturated band, and that flatness is the signal, it tells you at a glance that funding has been one-sided across the whole window.\n\nDeviation from average: colors against the rolling average instead, which surfaces the individual bars where funding ran rich or cheap relative to its recent norm. Use this when funding rarely moves and you want the exceptions to stand out.'

tooltip_display     = 'Coin reports volume, delta, liquidations and open interest in base units of the contract, which is how the exchange publishes them.\n\nQuote currency multiplies those rows by price to give notional value in whatever the contract settles in, so readings are comparable across assets and across time as price moves. Useful when watching several symbols side by side, or when comparing current activity against a period where price was far lower. A dollar sign is added when the symbol settles in a dollar unit.\n\nFunding stays a percentage and the closing price stays a price under both settings.'
tooltip_heat_len    = 'Lookback used to scale cell intensity. Each cell is shaded against the largest absolute value its own row produced across this window, so color always reads relative to recent conditions rather than a fixed scale that would go dark on quiet symbols.\n\nHow to choose it: shorter windows make the table reactive, so ordinary bars still show color and you can read rhythm. Longer windows reserve full saturation for genuine outliers, so the table stays dark until something unusual happens. 50 suits intraday work, 200 or more suits scanning for extremes.'
tooltip_ticks_row   = 'Price granularity the bid/ask engine uses when dissecting each bar internally, measured in ticks per price level.\n\nThis table reads bar totals only, never individual price levels, so this setting has no effect on any number you see. It is a performance control. A small value makes the engine build dozens of price levels per bar; a large value builds one or two and does the same job here. Leave it high.'
tooltip_engine      = 'Sets where the buy and sell split comes from.\n\nThe indicator reads volume footprint data, which requires a Premium or Ultimate plan. That data loads before any setting is read, so the requirement applies to the whole script regardless of the mode selected here.\n\nBid/ask engine: reads TradingView bid and ask data to show which side initiated each trade. Bars it cannot serve read as unavailable.\n\nBid/ask engine with estimate: the same, but bars the engine cannot serve fall back to a range-based approximation so the row stays continuous. Estimated cells are flagged with a tilde on the row tag.\n\nEstimate from bar range: approximates the split from where each bar closed within its range. Useful on symbols or periods where bid and ask data is thin.\n\nOff: leaves the four delta rows out entirely. Use this if you want a clean ten-row table of liquidations, open interest, funding and volume.'
tooltip_net_mode    = 'Sets how net long and net short are derived.\n\nDelta and OI split: net long is half the sum of delta and the open interest change, net short is half the difference. Both rows carry a value every bar and always reconcile back to delta and open interest, which makes them checkable against the rows above.\n\nPrice and OI quadrant: assigns the whole bar to a single side based on whether price and open interest rose or fell together. Reads more cleanly on trending charts, at the cost of leaving one of the two rows empty each bar.'
tooltip_swap        = 'Swaps the two raw liquidation feeds before anything else is applied. Only needed on the rare venue that publishes them inverted, which you would spot as liquidation clusters appearing on the wrong side of a sharp move.\n\nThis is separate from Liquidation Naming, which relabels the rows without touching the underlying data.'

tooltip_abbrev      = 'Abbreviates thousands and millions so cells stay narrow enough to scan at a glance.\n\nThis is not rounding. The abbreviated figure carries its decimals through, so 73950.12 reads 73.95K rather than 74K, and you keep the precision while gaining the space. Switch it off to print every figure in full, which suits wide panes and fewer columns.'
tooltip_decimals    = 'Precision applied to every printed figure.\n\nAuto keeps two decimals at or above 1 and six below it, then drops trailing zeros. A whole number stays whole, a fractional one keeps its digits, and small liquidation sizes stay readable instead of collapsing to 0.\n\nA fixed count overrides that when you want every cell aligned to identical precision, which reads more evenly in screenshots.'
tooltip_na_text     = 'Text printed when a feed does not exist for the symbol, or has no data for that bar.\n\nA genuine zero still prints as 0, so an empty reading and a missing reading are never confused with each other. Hover the row tag of any row showing this text for the specific reason it is unavailable.'

tooltip_show_names  = 'Shows the row name tags down the right side of the table.\n\nEach tag carries a tooltip explaining what that row measures, how to interpret it, and what it means if the cells are blank. Rows without data are dimmed and marked so you can see at a glance which statistics the current symbol supports.'
tooltip_name_style  = 'Short keeps the tag column narrow, which matters when the pane is short or you are running many rows. Full spells every row name out, which reads better in screenshots and when sharing setups with someone who has not used the table before.'
tooltip_name_gap    = 'Distance between the right edge of the last cell and the row name tags, measured in bars. Zero sits the tags flush against the table. Increase it if the tags crowd the final column of figures.'
tooltip_show_values = 'Prints the numeric value inside each cell on recent bars.\n\nTurn it off for a pure heat map. Color spans the full chart history, so with numbers off you can zoom out and read weeks or months of order flow as a single pattern, which is the fastest way to spot regime changes in funding, open interest and liquidation activity.'
tooltip_max_cols    = 'Upper bound on how many recent bars carry printed figures.\n\nColor spans the full chart history regardless. Text is drawn with label objects and the platform caps those at 500 per script, shared across every enabled row, so the real ceiling is 500 minus one tag per row divided by the row count. With every row enabled that is 34 columns, and raising this beyond 34 has no effect. Switch rows off to buy more columns, at seven rows the ceiling is 70.\n\nLabels are the most memory-hungry object a script can create, so keep this only as high as you actually read.'

tooltip_colors      = 'Pre-configured color schemes for the heat cells. Custom allows full control using the two color inputs below. Classic uses traditional green and red. Aqua provides ocean-inspired tones. Cosmic offers futuristic cyan and purple. Cyber features warm orange against cool cyan. Neon delivers high-contrast yellow and magenta for maximum visibility.\n\nText color inside every cell is calculated automatically from the cell shade, so figures stay legible on any scheme you pick.'
tooltip_bullish     = 'Color applied to positive readings, at full saturation for the strongest value in the lookback window. Only applies when Color Preset is set to Custom.'
tooltip_bearish     = 'Color applied to negative readings, at full saturation for the strongest value in the lookback window. Only applies when Color Preset is set to Custom.'
tooltip_zero        = 'Color applied to cells at or near zero. Every cell is painted on every bar, so this is what an inactive row looks like rather than an empty gap, which keeps the table reading as a solid grid.'
tooltip_gamma       = 'Curve applied to cell intensity.\n\nValues below 1 lift the mid-range so moderate activity still shows color and the table reads as a continuous gradient. Values above 1 suppress the mid-range so only genuine extremes light up and everything else stays dark. Lower it for rhythm, raise it for outlier hunting.'
tooltip_text_size   = 'Size of the printed figures inside each cell. Reduce it when running many rows in a short pane, or when you have raised Max Numbered Bars and the columns have narrowed.'
tooltip_tint_total  = 'Colors the total volume row by the sign of delta rather than by magnitude alone, so a heavy bar immediately reads as buyer or seller dominated and you get two pieces of information from one cell.'
tooltip_pane_bg     = 'Background color of the indicator pane behind the table.'

# Intraday Pullback Sniper (BB, Stoch RSI, Liquidity, HTF, Structure, Sessions)

Source: https://www.tradingview.com/script/R21J4eXT-Intraday-Pullback-Sniper-BB-Stoch-RSI-Liquidity-HTF/

## Description

An intraday entry-timing indicator. 
It looks for pullbacks into a Bollinger band in the direction of the higher-timeframe bias — buying dips in an up regime, selling rallies in a down one — and marks the candle where the pullback has run far enough and the lower-timeframe structure has turned back.

It marks conditions. It does not place stops, targets or position sizes, and it does not tell you to buy. That decision stays with you.

TWO DOTS, AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IS THE WHOLE IDEA

A small dot means a setup is armed. Four conditions on the same candle: the wick touched a band, the candle closed back inside and in the half that faces that band, the Stoch RSI was at its extreme within the last few candles, and the bias allows that direction. Read it as "price bounced off the band, I am watching."

A large dot means every enabled condition is met. On top of a setup still running from an earlier candle it needs the structure of the entry timeframe to have confirmed the turn, a second band touch with a rejection on this very candle, the bias, the liquidity sweep if you require one, an open session, and the cooldown after the last signal to have passed. Read it as "price did it a second time, and the structure turned in between."

The decisive part is the time gap. The band has to be touched twice, and the structure has to confirm between the two. A large dot can therefore never appear on the same candle as its own small dot — the following one at the earliest. A new small dot on a signal candle is normal: that candle meets the setup conditions as well, so it arms the next setup while the current one fires.

WHAT IT DRAWS

On the price chart: Bollinger Bands, the bias EMA, setup and signal dots with the price they occurred at, swing labels (HH / HL / LH / LL), market structure (BOS / CHOCH / MSB) for several timeframes, liquidity levels named by side and rank, and session boxes sized to the high and low each session made.

In its own pane: the Stoch RSI the logic actually runs on, its levels, dots at the extremes, the bias as a background tint, and a strip along the bottom that runs for as long as a setup is still waiting for its signal.

HOW SWINGS ARE FOUND

Everything structural — swing labels, market structure and liquidity — comes from one single engine using the classical definition of a turning point. A swing high is the highest candle of a window with the same number of candles on its left and on its right, so it is a local extreme in the literal sense. It is confirmed and never repainted, at the cost of a delay equal to that window.

Highs and lows strictly alternate. A second point of the same kind before the opposite one does not open a new leg; it replaces the current one if it is more extreme, otherwise it is discarded. Two degrees are calculated: a short one with a lookback of 2, the classic fractal, and a longer one for the larger move.

Structure breaks are judged on the close, never on wicks. A break with the prevailing direction is a BOS, one against it a CHOCH; both are MSB events.

Liquidity levels are swing points price has not closed beyond. Once a candle of that timeframe closes through a level, the orders resting there have been filled and the level is dropped. A wick through it with a close back on the old side is a sweep, not a break, so the level survives and is marked as swept.

HOW TO USE IT

Put the chart on the setup timeframe, 5 minutes by default. The entry timeframe must be lower than the chart; its candles are read from inside each chart candle. All higher-timeframe data comes from closed candles only, and signals are evaluated at the close of a chart candle, never intrabar.

The 5-minute default describes the preset, not a limit. Every timeframe is adjustable — a 15m chart with a 1H bias and 5m entry structure works the same way. The status table tells you if the chart and the setup timeframe do not match.

For alerts, pick "Any alert() function call" with the trigger "Once Per Bar Close". One alert then covers both directions, and the message carries symbol, direction, price, bias, setup direction, structure state, sweep and session. Separate SNIPER LONG and SNIPER SHORT conditions exist as well.

Every setting has a tooltip. Group 0 holds a glossary of the labels and a short guide to the alerts.

ON THE DEFAULTS

The defaults are deliberately on the safe side and the strict bias is on. If you get too few signals, switch conditions off one at a time and watch what changes — that is far more instructive than loosening several at once. The liquidity sweep is the one filter that is off by default; switch it on for the stricter variant.

LIMITATIONS, HONESTLY

Lower-timeframe data on TradingView is limited to a few months of intrabar history depending on your plan. Further back the entry structure and the signals that depend on it are missing, while everything else keeps drawing normally.

A swing is only confirmed after its window has passed, so the most recent candles cannot carry a label yet. That delay is the price of never repainting, and it is not a bug.

The indicator needs no volume, so it works on CFDs, forex and futures alike. It assumes continuous trading without large gaps — on instruments that gap overnight a band touch can come from the opening gap rather than from a rejection, and the logic is of little use there.

Suited to liquid, continuously traded instruments: index CFDs, major crypto, major forex pairs, liquid futures. On crypto the sessions carry no meaning; either switch all three off or trade the overlapping hours deliberately.

This is a tool for your own analysis, not financial advice. Past behaviour of any setup says nothing about future results.

//@version=6
// =============================================================================
//  Intraday Pullback Sniper (BB, Stoch RSI, Liquidity, HTF, Structure, Sessions)
//  SIGNAL ONLY  —  marks entries, leaves target and stop to the trader
//
//  WHAT IT DOES
//  Marks the candles where a complete setup exists and where all enabled entry
//  conditions are met. It does not manage trades: no stop, no targets, no
//  simulated position. Position sizing and exits stay with the trader.
//
//  READING THE TWO MARKERS  -  the one thing to understand before using this
//  The small dot is the starting gun, the large dot is the complete signal, and
//  the large one always needs a SECOND band touch on a LATER candle.
//
//  Small dot - a setup is armed. Four conditions, all on the same candle:
//    1. the wick touches the band
//    2. the candle closes back inside, and in the half that faces that band
//    3. the Stoch RSI was at its extreme within the last few candles
//    4. the bias allows that direction
//
//  Large dot - the signal. Seven conditions:
//    1. a setup from an earlier candle is running and has not expired
//    2. the structure of the entry timeframe is confirmed - depending on the
//       mode a Higher Low followed by a Higher High, a break of the last swing,
//       or both
//    3. there is a fresh band touch with a rejection on this very candle
//    4. the bias fits
//    5. the liquidity sweep is present, if it is required at all
//    6. the session is open
//    7. the cooldown after the last signal has passed
//
//  The decisive part is the time gap. The band has to be touched twice: once for
//  the setup, once for the signal, and in between the lower-timeframe structure
//  has to confirm the turn. A large dot can therefore never appear on the same
//  candle as its own small dot - the following one at the earliest.
//
//  What does happen: a new small dot on a signal candle. That candle meets the
//  setup conditions too, so it arms the next setup while it fires the current
//  signal.
//
//  In plain words: a small dot says "price bounced off the band, I am watching".
//  A large dot says "it did so a second time, and the structure turned in
//  between".
//
//  WHERE IT DRAWS
//  The script runs in its own pane below the chart, where the Stoch RSI that the
//  setup logic uses is plotted together with its levels, the bias as a background
//  tint and a strip showing how long a setup is still waiting for its entry.
//  Everything belonging to price - bands, EMA, markers, structure, liquidity and
//  the status table - is drawn onto the price chart from there.
//
//  HOW SWINGS ARE FOUND
//  Everything structural in this script - swing labels, market structure and
//  liquidity - comes from one single swing engine using the classical definition
//  of a turning point:
//    * a swing high is a SYMMETRIC pivot: the highest candle of a window with
//      "lookback" candles on its left and the same number on its right, so it is
//      a local extreme in the literal sense, confirmed and never repainted
//    * highs and lows strictly alternate; a second point of the same kind before
//      the opposite one only replaces the current one if it is more extreme
//    * a minimum number of candles between two points (backstep), and optionally
//      a minimum leg size, which is off by default
//  Two degrees are calculated: a short one with a lookback of 2 - the classic
//  fractal - for the detail, and a long one with the standard pivot value of 10
//  for the larger move. Reading a chart in more than one degree of movement is
//  the oldest principle in technical analysis.
//  Structure breaks are judged on the CLOSE, not on wicks. A break in the
//  direction of the prevailing structure is a BOS, one against it a CHOCH; both
//  are MSB events.
//
//  HOW TO USE
//  * Put the chart on the setup timeframe (5 minutes by default).
//  * The entry timeframe must be lower than the chart. Its candles are read with
//    request.security_lower_tf(), which does not repaint but is limited to a few
//    months of intrabar history depending on your TradingView plan.
//  * All higher-timeframe data is taken from CLOSED candles only.
//  * Signals are evaluated at the close of a chart candle.
//
//  DEVIATION FROM THE ORIGINAL SPECIFICATION
//  §52 sets the setup expiration to 5 x 1m bars, which on a 5m chart is a single
//  candle - the entry is only checked from the following bar, so nothing could
//  ever trigger. Default here is 30 (6 chart bars, 5 of them usable).

For a low that means the high it came from was later exceeded by a higher high - buyers pushed past the previous peak, so the low behind them held. Mirrored for a high.\nLower-case names on a thinner line are SIMPLE levels: real turning points, but ones the market has not yet had to defend. They can still be hit, they just carry less weight.\nThe two are counted separately, so BSL1 and bsl1 can both exist at the same time.\nThe short form H2 and L2 can be chosen instead in the liquidity settings.\nRanking is by distance, not by age, so a level can move from H2 to H1 when the one in front of it is cleared.\n'swept' behind the name means price ran through the level and closed back on the old side - the orders resting there have been taken.\n\nMARKERS\nA small dot below or above a candle marks an armed setup.

//     repainted, at the cost of a delay of "len" candles
//   * strict alternation of highs and lows; a same-kind pivot before the opposite
//     one only replaces the current point if it is more extreme
